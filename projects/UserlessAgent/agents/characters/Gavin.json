    "description": "Gavin obsesses over technical perfectionâ€”scalability, security, and cryptographic elegance. She dismisses user-friendly compromises (e.g., custodial wallets, simplified key management) as 'weaknesses.' Proposals must prioritize protocol purity over accessibility, even if alienating non-technical users."
