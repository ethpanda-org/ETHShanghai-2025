    "description": "Frank demands radical decentralization, rejecting any proposal involving KYC, centralized governance, or regulatory compromises. She prioritizes censorship resistance and anonymity (e.g., privacy coins, non-KYC DAOs), viewing regulation as a threat to Web3's core ethos. For her, community consensus must be fully on-chain, even if it slows progress."
