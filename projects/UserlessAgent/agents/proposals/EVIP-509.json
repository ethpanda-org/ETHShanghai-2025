  "title": "Increase the Minimum Quorum Requirement for Proposal Validity",
  "proposer": "Player Alice",
  "date_of_submission": "03/29/2025",
  "summary": "This proposal seeks to amend the minimum quorum requirement for the validity of governance proposals in UserlessAgent from the current 600,000 to 800,000 tokens. The goal of this change is to improve the legitimacy and representativeness of decisions made through the UserlessAgent governance system by ensuring a higher level of participation.",
  "rationale": {
    "point_1": "Increase the participation threshold: Raising the quorum ensures that proposals are approved by a broader and more engaged portion of the community, ensuring that decisions are more representative of the entire governance body.",
    "point_2": "Improve proposal quality: A higher quorum will likely encourage more active participation and higher-quality debate and deliberation on proposals, as it would require more commitment to reach the necessary threshold.",
    "point_3": "Maintain network integrity: This change will align EchoVote's governance mechanism with best practices from other decentralized organizations that have seen success with higher quorum requirements, leading to more robust and sustainable decision-making."
