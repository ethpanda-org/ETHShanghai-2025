Summary

This proposal requests a total allocation of

30,000 frxUSD and

36,000 FRAX from the

Fraxtal Ecosystem Fund , divided into:

30,000 frxUSD Grant — to support continued development of EchoMarket’s AI, analytics, and product infrastructure.

24,000 FRAX Campaign Budget — to fund Frax Finance awareness campaigns directly on EchoMarket.

12,000 FRAX Strategic KOL Fund — to engage and onboard key influencers and creators who will promote Frax products across social platforms.

EchoMarket is a Fraxtal-native platform that runs AI-scored, onchain campaigns rewarding creators and communities on Fraxtal, helping grow Frax’s user base, visibility, and cultural footprint across Web3.

Background & Motivation

EchoMarket began in late 2024 as a small experimental project by Frax contributors exploring how

AI and blockchain could make creator incentives transparent and verifiable. The idea quickly gained traction, and by early 2025 a dedicated team from early Fraxtal hackathon winners and community members formed to build a Fraxtal-native MVP.

In

June 2025 , EchoMarket officially launched as one of the first Fraxtal-native social applications. Early pilot campaigns with

Frax Finance and ecosystem partners distributed all rewards directly on fraxtal in frxUSD or WFRAX , validating the model of automated, AI-scored, and transparent incentives.

Since launch, EchoMarket has achieved significant early traction:

Over

1,000,000 validated impressions generated through verified, AI-scored campaigns.

More than

144 active creators producing content and participating in onchain incentive programs.

EchoMarket directly supports

Frax Finance’s long-term ecosystem goals by:

Creating onchain transactions on the Fraxtal network through campaign activity and reward distribution.

Expanding frxUSD or WFRAX adoption as the default incentive currency for creators.

Building cultural mindshare through authentic, creator-driven storytelling and engagement.

Providing transparent, onchain tools for campaign management, analytics, and reward automation.

Bringing the next generation of crypto KOLs and community builders to Fraxtal and introducing them to Frax products.

EchoMarket’s mission is to become the onchain incentive layer for creators and communities , powered by frxUSD and WFRAX and built natively on

Fraxtal — bridging crypto assets utility, social influence, and cultural growth.

Proposal Details

Total Requested:

30,000 frxUSD + 36,000 FRAX

Proposal budget period:

6 months from the receiving of the payment.

Breakdown:

1. Product & AI Development Grant — 30,000 frxUSD

This 6-month grant will improve EchoMarket’s existing AI and verification systems while expanding its infrastructure for onboarding and community building.

Echo AI Feedback Loop & Multi-Engine Scoring:

Echo AI already powers campaign scoring, but it will be upgraded with a full feedback loop that learns from campaign outcomes and creator input. Multiple AI engines will work in parallel to cross-check content quality, and relevance for more accurate and adaptive rewards.

Anti-Fraud & Real-View Detection:

EchoMarket already tracks real engagement, and this upgrade will make detection faster and smarter—filtering fake impressions, bot activity, and low-quality traffic. The goal is to highlight verified human attention and strengthen trust in every campaign.

Communities and Guilds:

Add project specific community pages for extra marketing, information and community building activities. Add onchain “Guilds” so creators can join campaigns collectively and share rewards transparently, fostering collaboration and long-term participation on Fraxtal.

Account Abstraction & Seamless Onboarding:

Enable

Web2 users and KOLs to use Fraxtal without realizing it through account abstraction and smart sessions. Joining campaigns will be as easy as logging into a social platform, removing technical friction for new users.

2. Frax Finance Campaign Budget — 24,000 FRAX

A 6-month budget to run a series of

Frax-related awareness and education campaigns on

EchoMarket .

These campaigns will be designed by the Frax Core Team and executed transparently through EchoMarket’s on-chain system, similar in structure to earlier

Frax Education initiatives.

All rewards will be paid in

WFRAX and verified by EchoMarket’s AI engine to ensure real engagement and quality content.

If activity or participation falls below expectations, any unused funds will be returned to the Fraxtal Ecosystem Fund at the end of the 6-month period.

3. Strategic KOL Onboarding Fund — 12,000 FRAX

We aim to create the first official KoL program for Frax. We will try several distinct strategies to find the solutions that work and bring the most traction for Frax. There are several criterias that are important. Quality, real reach, accuracy, alignment are among them.

Launch the

Frax KOL Program , onboarding high-impact creators and community leaders.

Run co-marketing initiatives with verified KOLs to amplify Frax’s reach across DeFi and crypto communities. Prioritize authentic, long-term partnerships with creators who align with Frax’s mission and ecosystem.

Establish a renewable KOL network reviewed bi-yearly based on performance and results.

Stake DAO contributors and Frax core team

Summary

This proposal amends FIP-434 to allow sfrxUSD Curve AMOs to optionally route through Stake DAO’s OnlyBoost system when it provides higher effective yield. OnlyBoost is a neutral optimizer that dynamically allocates liquidity between Convex and Stake DAO infrastructure, always selecting the configuration that maximizes realized CRV rewards.

Background and Motivation

The Frax protocol’s objective with sfrxUSD AMOs is simple: maximize net yield in a risk-neutral way while maintaining broad ecosystem alignment.

OnlyBoost enhances this mission by:

Dynamic routing: Liquidity is directed between Stake DAO and Convex depending on which delivers the highest boost.

Convex alignment: When Convex is the optimal venue, OnlyBoost routes deposits directly there.

No extra cost: There are no additional fees, guaranteeing equal or higher net yield versus current AMO design.

Staking V2 benefits:

Instant reward distribution (no 7-day streaming delay).

No loss of accrued rewards on withdrawal.

Mutualised harvesting ensures rewards are always flowing.

This design ensures sfrxUSD Curve AMOs fully capture available veCRV boost, leveraging Stake DAO’s own veCRV, Convex’s veCRV, and veCRV delegations from Curve team. Importantly, Frax does not favor one venue over another — routing is determined purely by realized yield outcomes.

Proposal

Extend Curve AMOs from FIP-434 (sfrxUSD/frxUSD, sfrxUSD/reUSD, sfrxUSD/USDe, sfrxUSD/dUSD) to also include Stake DAO OnlyBoost when it maximizes revenue.

Allocation caps remain unchanged.

Rationale

Best yield guarantee: Onlyboost dynamic routing between Stake DAO & Convex for maximum CRV rewards.

No extra cost: OnlyBoost takes no additional fee on Convex allocations.

Faster reward distribution: going through Onlyboost would allow instant reward distribution to Frax, and wouldn’t introduce any delay for the part going through Convex’s booster

Risk neutral: Assets remain in Curve pools. Stake DAO contracts are audited and protected by Hypernative

Voting

For: Add Stake DAO OnlyBoost as eligible venue for sfrxUSD Curve AMOs.

Summary

This proposal builds on

FIP-430 , which established a separate balance sheet and governance-guided yield strategy for sfrxUSD, by whitelisting an initial set of AMO strategies with allocation caps and setting clear rules for how future strategies are approved. The aim is to ensure sfrxUSD remains the onchain benchmark yield stablecoin, with allocations that are transparent, risk-managed, and always guided by a minimum yield rule to prevent subsidizing below-market opportunities.

Background and Motivation sfrxUSD was launched as part of Frax’s Payment Stablecoin Charter framework to serve as the onchain benchmark USD yield stablecoin. In FIP-430, the DAO approved the establishment of a separate sfrxUSD balance sheet with governance-guided yield strategies, ensuring its liabilities and assets remain isolated from legacy FRAX and frxUSD reserves.

With sfrxUSD now upgraded, the next step is to whitelist initial AMO strategies and provide a framework for how future strategies will be evaluated. This proposal clarifies which venues may receive sfrxUSD allocations, sets maximum caps for each, and establishes rules for approving new strategies. It also introduces a minimum yield rule to ensure allocations are capital-efficient and always benchmarked against the current sfrxUSD APY.

The objective is to create a clear, durable framework that both operationalizes sfrxUSD in DeFi and provides governance with consistent criteria for evaluating future opportunities.

Rules for Adding New Strategies

To maintain the safety, credibility, and efficiency of the sfrxUSD balance sheet, any future strategies beyond the initial whitelist will be subject to the following rules and must be approved through Frax governance:

Asset Requirement

Underlying assets must be blue chip USD-denominated stablecoins.

Volatile collateral or purely speculative assets are not eligible.

Protocol Requirement

Protocol must be a blue chip platform with at least $1B+ TVL.

Only venues with strong track records and robust security are eligible.

Caps for Third-Party Requests

Any strategy proposed by an external protocol will be capped at the lower of $2M or 1% of total sfrxUSD TVL during its initial whitelisting phase.

These caps may only be increased through a subsequent governance vote after the strategy has demonstrated sufficient performance and risk management.

Strategies initiated by the Frax core team are not subject to this cap and may exceed these limits if approved by governance.

Discretionary Allocation

Actual allocations are at the discretion of the Frax core team and internal risk team, based on prevailing market conditions, liquidity needs, and risk assessments.

Allocations will be managed dynamically to ensure sfrxUSD maintains a competitive rate compared to other stablecoin opportunities, reinforcing its role as the benchmark onchain risk-adjusted yield.

Yield Floor Rule

To be eligible as a whitelisted strategy, a venue must demonstrate a sustained effective yield higher than the current epoch sfrxUSD APY.

Short-term APR spikes (e.g., from temporary incentives or wash activity) will not qualify.

Governance and the Frax risk team may use rolling averages or time-weighted APYs to evaluate yields and prevent manipulation.

Additional Notes

The sfrxUSD balance sheet must be managed conservatively to protect its role as the benchmark onchain risk-adjusted yield. Allocating capital below the current epoch sfrxUSD APY creates direct opportunity costs for holders and risks effectively subsidizing external protocols. At the same time, over-allocation can stress the sfrxUSD ↔ frxUSD redemption balance, since a large portion of lent assets may be borrowed and sold. The minimum yield rule and sustained-yield requirement ensures sfrxUSD allocations are both capital-efficient and resistant to APR gaming, while governance caps prevent smaller protocols from lobbying for disproportionate allocations.

Voting

For: Approve the listed sfrxUSD AMO whitelist with allocation caps, and adopt rules for adding new strategies

Against: Do nothing.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0xf82c0687e36b14db012b74c2cda40405fc681635f83727117fb9045a835e8333

Rate Type

Chain

Max LTV

Fraxlend Pair Address frxUSD

OGN

Variable Rate V2

Ethereum

TBD

TBD

Motivation

The proposal seeks to introduce a new market into Fraxlend on Ethereum for OGN. The new market would lead to increased TVL for Fraxlend, additional revenue to the Frax Protocol and DAO from active loans and liquidations, and will attract a wider user base. At the moment there is only one market for using OGN as collateral, and it is on the Base chain. This could be the first market on mainnet for borrowing against OGN.

Background

Origin Token (OGN) is the governance and value accrual ERC20 token for Origin Protocol. OGN is an older token that launched in 2018 and has gone through several iterations over the years. OGN has more than 46,000 holders across mainnet, Base, and Sonic. Holders who choose to stake OGN for xOGN receive DAO voting power,

100% of Origin Protocol’s protocol revenue from performance fees from Origin’s products, as well as periodic distributions of the Origin Protocol DAO’s treasury assets. TVL for Origin’s products can be found on the Origin analytics page.

OGN has been heavily audited by OpenZeppelin and other reputable auditing firms, with audits being conducted quarterly. Previous audits can be found in the OGN docs. OGN pricing can be determined using the OGN/USD Pyth oracle, Uniswap TWAP oracle, or the Coingecko pricing API.

OGN is listed on 50+ exchanges globally, OGN liquidity pools are currently available across various DEXs:

Uniswap: OGN/ETH

Curve: TriOGN

Aerodrome: OGN/superOETHb

Swapx: OGN/OS

OGN mainnet contract address: 0x8207c1FfC5B6804F6024322CcF34F29c3541Ae26

Frax Core Team

Summary

This proposal seeks to delegate the full compliance infrastructure and collateral management of frxUSD to FRAX Inc (previously known as FinresPBC), the public benefit corporation responsible for regulatory operations. FRAX Inc will manage all issuer responsibilities—including collateral onboarding, compliance audits, custodian integrations—and will only retain sufficient revenue to cover its operational expenses for delegated operations. All surplus revenue generated from frxUSD issuance will be returned to the Frax DAO treasury to the benefit of FRAX (prev. FXS) token holders.

Background and Motivation

As Frax Finance advances toward GENIUS Bill regulatory compliance for frxUSD in anticipation of U.S. stablecoin legislation, it is crucial to unify the off-chain and legal components of the system in a formally structured and regulated entity. FRAX Inc is structured to serve as the operational entity responsible for issuing frxUSD and managing its underlying collateral in accordance with regulatory standards.

Currently, elements of the compliance process and collateral deployment are shared between the DAO and external entities, creating operational inefficiencies and regulatory ambiguity. This proposal fully transfers those responsibilities to FRAX Inc, while maintaining DAO oversight through revenue routing and the ability to override via governance vote in the future. This structure establishes a clear legal and operational boundary, supporting FRAX Inc’s pursuit of a payment stablecoin license and enabling full autonomy within regulated jurisdictions.

This proposal solves the need for FRAX Inc to perform important stablecoin issuance, compliance, and partnership activities without explicitly having to get affirmative approval from FRAX token holders for every action, an infeasible expectation that will be detrimental in competing with centralized issuers like Circle, Tether, Paxos etc.

Proposal Details

Transfer Scope:

FRAX Inc will be authorized to permanently manage the full compliance operations and collateral composition for frxUSD. This includes:

Onboarding and managing RWA custodians, regulated issuers (e.g., Blackrock, Fidelity, Superstate), opening/closing bank accounts, and creating relationships (including strategic partnerships) with institutions and associated entities for frxUSD expansion.

Ensuring ongoing compliance with regulatory obligations and applying for the correct legal licensing within the United States (including associated costs and management). In particular, the FRAX Inc entity is delegated sole authority to structure the corporation, frxUSD balance sheet, and legal aspects of the business in any way its board and employees see fit to have frxUSD comply with, apply for, and receive the GENIUS Bill stablecoin license within the United States.

Handle all intellectual property rights of Frax USD (frxUSD), the regulated stablecoin.

DAO Revenue Rights:

FRAX Inc will only retain enough income to cover operational and regulatory expenses (e.g., legal, audit). FRAX Inc will report annual breakdown of revenue, expenses, and profits (returned income) to the Frax DAO in a timely manner after every calendar end year of December 31st.

All surplus profits generated from frxUSD operations will be transferred back to Frax DAO to the benefit of FRAX token holders.

Governance Controls:

A future governance vote may revoke, modify, or reassign this delegation.

Voting

For: Approve the transfer of frxUSD compliance and collateral management to FRAX Inc, with DAO retention of all net revenue.

Against: Do nothing.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0x261a34f3875479eff45fe653eb11e591fe94b908c80574dcaee880964cb4111a

This is a revised version of the

FIP-431 proposal which did not pass in the previous voting round.

To better align with the strategic interests of the ecosystem and increase community support, we’ve updated the proposal by replacing SwapX with

Curve as the main DEX venue for Frax's liquidity deployment on Sonic. All other components of the original proposal remain unchanged. We believe this adjustment significantly strengthens the proposal’s alignment with

Frax -

Curve -

Convex ecosystem priorities and invite the community to support this collaborative expansion effort.

In continued collaboration with Frax, dTRINITY has expanded to the

Sonic network where Frax already launched frxUSD and sfrxUSD. To catalyze both projects' early adoption in this fast-growing ecosystem, we're proposing to reallocate Frax's liquidity support from FIP-416 ($2 million) toward dUSD markets on Sonic.

Additionally, the liquidity will come from the sfrxUSD vault instead of Frax's AMO in order to align with the Frax North Star Vision's strategic mission. Therefore, this is now a

DeFi Strategy Proposal to deploy $2M frxUSD from the sfrxUSD vault into dUSD markets on Sonic in Q2 ' 25 .

II. STRATEGY PROPOSAL $1M frxUSD will be used to mint and supply dUSD on dLEND —an Aave v3 fork. dTRINITY will then re-allocate the frxUSD into

Rings Protocol , receiving wstkscUSD back as reserves. –

Benefit 1:

Frax earns lending yield + dT Points from dTRINITY –

Benefit 2: dUSD gains reserves + wstkscUSD underlying yield to fund subsidies –

Benefit 3: dUSD lending supply increases, providing fuel to enable credit expansion $1M frxUSD will be LP in the frxUSD/dUSD pool on Curve, half of which will be used to mint dUSD first. The frxUSD used to mint dUSD will also be re-allocated into wstkscUSD. –

Benefit 1:

Frax earns pool fees + dT + emissions from Curve –

Benefit 2: dUSD gains reserves + wstkscUSD underlying yield to fund subsidies –

Benefit 3: dUSD price stability is strengthened as credit utilization increases –

Benefit 4: dUSD credit velocity and expansion become more sustainable

DeFi Flywheel Effect: sfrxUSD secures dUSD + funds dUSD borrowing subsidies + provides dUSD credit supply

Subsidies lower dUSD Borrow APR + increase borrowing demand + raise credit utilization

Higher utilization raises dUSD Supply APR to above-market rates + attracts lenders, providing more credit supply sfrxUSD helps stabilize dUSD + sustain credit velocity as dTRINITY's TVL expands sfrxUSD APR increases, powered by dUSD Supply APR + pool fees/emissions + dT

More users acquire sfrxUSD to earn better yield, growing Frax's TVL

Repeat from Step 1 (as applicable)

III. ALPHA GENERATION

Sustainability: dUSD borrowing subsidies are funded exogenously by sfrxUSD—ultimately coming from Frax's stablecoin reserves, CDPs in Fraxlend, and cash equivalent RWA assets held at custodians. Therefore, the subsidy flow is renewable and sustainable.

Lower Rates, Higher Yields: dUSD borrowing subsidies shifts the demand curve upward to the right, creating a higher equilibrium of supply/demand on dLEND vs. unsubsidized stablecoins on other lending protocols. In other words, users are willing to borrow and pay MORE in raw interest expenses if they receive subsidies (interest rebates). This means dUSD lenders also earn more yield—including the sfrxUSD vault. Effectively, what's given away as subsidies to the demand side eventually comes back to the supply side as above-market lending rates.

Below is a classic supply/demand chart illustrating the effect of borrowing subsidies. dT Points: dUSD lenders—including the sfrxUSD vault—earn points from dTRINITY which will convert to utility tokens at the future TGE. They are endogenous supply-side rewards designed to complement exogenous demand-side subsidies, balancing incentives to attract more lenders and enable further credit expansion.

Consistent Utilization:

Demand-side subsidies typically outperform supply-side rewards. Although incentivizing lenders may attract more supply to reduce the borrowing cost, it could only go down to as low as 0% Borrow APR. On the other hand, subsidizing borrowers directly produces negative Net Borrow APRs when there's low utilization (i.e., getting paid instead of paying to borrow). In addition, dUSD Net Borrow APR is often lower than its Suppy APR thanks to subsidies—a completely opposite dynamic vs. other lending markets. Hence, borrowing subsidies can effectively ""guarantee"" a higher than average level of supply utilization for dUSD vs. unsubsidized stablecoins.

Below is a subsidized Net Borrow APR curve example. Note that subsidies greatly amplify negative borrowing rates at low utilization because there is less debt vs. available subsidies.

Below is a recent screenshot of dLEND on Fraxtal, showing a negative dUSD Net Borrow APR.

Historical examples of superior dUSD rates vs. unsubsidized stablecoins (Q1 '25):

March: https://x.com/dTRINITY_DeFi/status/1900987616532767159

IV. POTENTIAL RISKS & MITIGATIONS

Liquidity & Depeg Risk: dUSD is not redeemable directly and can only be exchanged for available liquidity in the frxUSD/dUSD Curve pool. This could lead to liquidity constraints when there is more dUSD selling pressure, causing it to depeg. If dUSD trades at a large discount below $1, the sfrxUSD vault could experience unrealized losses. Potential risk mitigations include: --

Arbitrageurs:

Market participants (e.g., existing dUSD borrowers, LPs, market makers) can add liquidity or buy dUSD when it trades at a discount to restore stability and capture arbitrage opportunities --

Liquidity Incentives: dTRINITY and Frax can co-incentivize the frxUSD/dUSD pool on Curve to attract more LPs, bolstering liquidity and peg stability --

Stability Market Operation (SMO): dTRINITY can use its reserves to buy back dUSD on the open market through SMOs, restoring stability and liquidity in the frxUSD/dUSD pool.

Bad Debt Risk:

If the collateral securing dUSD debt on dLEND is not adequately liquidated, the sfrxUSD vault's lending position on dLEND could potentially experience losses from bad debt. Potential risk mitigations include: --

Lower LLTV Ratios: dLEND's LLTV is 85% for stable/yieldcoin collateral (e.g., sfrxUSD, sUSDe) and 65% for volatile assets. This is lower than other lending protocols which often set LLTV for stable/yieldcoin collateral to 90-95%. Thanks to borrowing subsidies, dLEND users don't need high leverage to achieve similar returns like on other protocols --

No Collateral Rehypothecation:

Collateral securing dUSD debt is not relent in order to prevent cascading liquidations and potential contagion across other dLEND markets

Smart Contract Risk:

Vulnerabilities in dTRINITY’s smart contracts, including dUSD and dLEND contracts, could lead to potential exploits and, in turn, losses for the sfrxUSD vault. Risks include bugs in the code, governance manipulation, or attacks on integrations with external protocols (e.g., Curve). Potential risk mitigations include: --

Audits: dTRINITY has completed 3 separate smart contract audits with leading security firms including Halborn, Cyberscope, and Verichains. A 4th audit is also planned for this quarter --

Bug Bounty: dTRINITY will soon release a public bug bounty program to reward white-hats with dUSD + dT Points for identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities

[FIP-431] dTRINITY x Frax Joint Expansion on Sonic,[FIP-431] dTRINITY x Frax Joint Expansion on Sonic,"May 7, 2025 · 10:45 PM","May 7, 2025 · 10:45 PM","May 12, 2025 · 10:45 PM","I. OVERVIEW

Since the debut of dUSD and dLEND on Fraxtal in December, dTRINITY has grown to $4.5M+ TVL by the end of Q1 '25, becoming the largest native dApp and lending protocol on Fraxtal. Our subsidized stablecoin model—the first of its kind in DeFi—quickly gained adoption from the Fraxtal community, with strong product/market fit proven through superior stablecoin rates and consistently high utilization.

This growth was achieved even prior to AMO liquidity deployment from Frax to support dUSD markets, per

FIP-416 which was approved in December.

In continued collaboration with Frax, dTRINITY will soon expand to the

Sonic network where Frax has already launched frxUSD and sfrxUSD. To catalyze both projects' early adoption in this fast-growing ecosystem, we're proposing to reallocate Frax's liquidity support from FIP-416 ($2 million) toward dUSD markets on Sonic.

Additionally, the liquidity will come from the sfrxUSD vault instead of Frax's AMO in order to align with the Frax North Star Vision's strategic mission. Therefore, this is now a

DeFi Strategy Proposal to deploy $2M frxUSD from the sfrxUSD vault into dUSD markets on Sonic in Q2 ' 25 .

II. STRATEGY PROPOSAL $1M frxUSD will be used to mint and supply dUSD on dLEND—an Aave v3 fork. dTRINITY will then stake the frxUSD with Frax, receiving sfrxUSD as reserve backing for dUSD --

Benefit 1:

Frax earns lending yield + dT Points from dTRINITY --

Benefit 2: sfrxUSD supply increases + frxUSD is returned to the vault via staking --

Benefit 3: dUSD gains reserves + sfrxUSD underlying yield to fund subsidies --

Benefit 4: dUSD lending supply increases, providing fuel to enable credit expansion $1M frxUSD will be LP in the frxUSD/dUSD pool on

SwapX —a leading Sonic DEX --

Benefit 1:

Frax earns pool fees + dT + emissions from Swapx --

Benefit 2: dUSD price stability is strengthened as credit utilization increases --

Benefit 3: dUSD credit velocity and expansion become more sustainable

DeFi Flywheel Effect: sfrxUSD secures dUSD + funds dUSD borrowing subsidies + provides dUSD credit supply

Subsidies lower dUSD Borrow APR + increase borrowing demand + raise credit utilization

Higher utilization raises dUSD Supply APR to above-market rates + attracts lenders, providing more credit supply sfrxUSD helps stabilize dUSD + sustain credit velocity as dTRINITY's TVL expands sfrxUSD APR increases, powered by dUSD Supply APR + pool fees/emissions + dT

More users acquire sfrxUSD to earn better yield, growing Frax's TVL

Repeat from Step 1 (as applicable)

III. ALPHA GENERATION

Sustainability: dUSD borrowing subsidies are funded exogenously by sfrxUSD—ultimately coming from Frax's stablecoin reserves, CDPs in Fraxlend, and cash equivalent RWA assets held at custodians. Therefore, the subsidy flow is renewable and sustainable.

Lower Rates, Higher Yields: dUSD borrowing subsidies shifts the demand curve upward to the right, creating a higher equilibrium of supply/demand on dLEND vs. unsubsidized stablecoins on other lending protocols. In other words, users are willing to borrow and pay MORE in raw interest expenses if they receive subsidies (interest rebates). This means dUSD lenders also earn more yield—including the sfrxUSD vault. Effectively, what's given away as subsidies to the demand side eventually comes back to the supply side as above-market lending rates.

Below is a classic supply/demand chart illustrating the effect of borrowing subsidies. dT Points: dUSD lenders—including the sfrxUSD vault—earn points from dTRINITY which will convert to utility tokens at the future TGE. They are endogenous supply-side rewards designed to complement exogenous demand-side subsidies, balancing incentives to attract more lenders and enable further credit expansion.

Consistent Utilization:

Demand-side subsidies typically outperform supply-side rewards. Although incentivizing lenders may attract more supply to reduce the borrowing cost, it could only go down to as low as 0% Borrow APR. On the other hand, subsidizing borrowers directly produces negative Net Borrow APRs when there's low utilization (i.e., getting paid instead of paying to borrow). In addition, dUSD Net Borrow APR is often lower than its Suppy APR thanks to subsidies—a completely opposite dynamic vs. other lending markets. Hence, borrowing subsidies can effectively ""guarantee"" a higher than average level of supply utilization for dUSD vs. unsubsidized stablecoins.

Below is a subsidized Net Borrow APR curve example. Note that subsidies greatly amplify negative borrowing rates at low utilization because there is less debt vs. available subsidies.

Below is a recent screenshot of dLEND on Fraxtal, showing a negative dUSD Net Borrow APR.

March: https://x.com/dTRINITY_DeFi/status/1900987616532767159

IV. POTENTIAL RISKS & MITIGATIONS

Liquidity & Depeg Risk: dUSD is not redeemable directly and can only be exchanged for available liquidity in the frxUSD/dUSD Curve pool. This could lead to liquidity constraints when there is more dUSD selling pressure, causing it to depeg. If dUSD trades at a large discount below $1, the sfrxUSD vault could experience unrealized losses. Potential risk mitigations include: --

Arbitrageurs:

Market participants (e.g., existing dUSD borrowers, LPs, market makers) can add liquidity or buy dUSD when it trades at a discount to restore stability and capture arbitrage opportunities --

Liquidity Incentives: dTRINITY and Frax can co-incentivize the frxUSD/dUSD pool on SwapX to attract more LPs, bolstering liquidity and peg stability --

Stability Market Operation (SMO): dTRINITY can use its reserves to buy back dUSD on the open market through SMOs, restoring stability and liquidity in the frxUSD/dUSD pool. To date, dTRINITY has successfully executed 6 SMOs since its launch, most recently yesterday: https://x.com/dTRINITY_DeFi/status/1910742827023356341

Bad Debt Risk:

If the collateral securing dUSD debt on dLEND is not adequately liquidated, the sfrxUSD vault's lending position on dLEND could potentially experience losses from bad debt. Potential risk mitigations include: --

Lower LLTV Ratios: dLEND's LLTV is 85% for stable/yieldcoin collateral (e.g., sfrxUSD, sUSDe) and 65% for volatile assets. This is lower than other lending protocols which often set LLTV for stable/yieldcoin collateral to 90-95%. Thanks to borrowing subsidies, dLEND users don't need high leverage to achieve similar returns like on other protocols --

No Collateral Rehypothecation:

Collateral securing dUSD debt is not relent in order to prevent cascading liquidations and potential contagion across other dLEND markets

Smart Contract Risk:

Vulnerabilities in dTRINITY’s smart contracts, including dUSD and dLEND contracts, could lead to potential exploits and, in turn, losses for the sfrxUSD vault. Risks include bugs in the code, governance manipulation, or attacks on integrations with external protocols (e.g., SwapX). Potential risk mitigations include: --

Audits: dTRINITY has completed 3 separate smart contract audits with leading security firms including Halborn, Cyberscope, and Verichains. A 4th audit is also planned for this quarter --

Bug Bounty: dTRINITY will soon release a public bug bounty program to reward white-hats with dUSD + dT Points for identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities

Frax Core Team

Summary

As the United States Congress gets closer to passing landmark stablecoin legislation and Frax prepares for becoming one of the first legally recognized digital dollar stablecoins, certain changes must be made. This proposal prepares the frxUSD stablecoin for regulatory compliance to become a U.S. payment stablecoin. In response to upcoming legislation as well as application requirements for a U.S. payment stablecoin charter via Financial Reserves and Asset Exploration Inc (currently referred to as FinresPBC for short and will be referred to as FRAX Inc should this proposal pass). The Frax Finance DAO will need to isolate frxUSD’s balance sheet as a fully compliant, RWA fiat-redeemable stablecoin. This FIP proposes (1) establishing two distinct balance sheets—one for Legacy FRAX Dollar and one for frxUSD, (2) ending the migration period between Legacy FRAX Dollar and frxUSD for compliance reasons (3) transitioning FXB redemption flows appropriately, and (4) affirming a separate balance sheet for sfrxUSD and formalizing its yield strategies via AMOs.

Background and Motivation

Frax USD (frxUSD) is the next-generation stablecoin architecture under the Frax ecosystem, designed with modularity, regulatory compliance, and transparency at its core. The Legacy FRAX Dollar stablecoin, while foundational to the protocol’s original growth, operates under a different economic model that would not be compatible with US legislation currently proposed by Congress known as the GENIUS Act & the STABLE Act. These features include the Algorithmic Market Operations (AMO) system and other historical mechanics that do not match the anticipated standards of upcoming U.S. payment stablecoin regulation which frxUSD seeks to comply with.

As Frax Finance prepares for Frax Inc (aka FinresPBC) to pursue a payment stablecoin charter, it becomes necessary to fully separate the two systems and support each one in a positive sum manner. Legacy FRAX Dollar will continue to operate under its AMO-driven, DeFi-native model, while frxUSD will maintain a regulated, RWA fiat-redeemable architecture designed for compliance.

Proposal Details

Separation of Balance Sheets

The backing and assets that support frxUSD will be clearly separated from those that support Legacy FRAX Dollar stablecoins.

All reserve accounting and reporting will treat frxUSD and Legacy FRAX Dollar as independent monetary systems, with distinct portfolios and liabilities.

Ending Migration Period Between Legacy FRAX and frxUSD

The migration from Legacy FRAX Dollar to frxUSD and sFRAX to sfrxUSD will come to an end. While any user can swap between the two stablecoins on secondary markets such as Curve, Balancer, Uniswap etc, the Frax Finance DAO will no longer guarantee 1-to-1 migration between Legacy FRAX Dollar and frxUSD.

This removes the de facto unified balance sheet between the two stablecoins if 1-to-1 migration was open indefinitely, allowing frxUSD to maintain a regulatory-compliant, fiat-redeemable status without exposure to onchain mechanisms.

To ensure user flexibility and smooth operation during the transition period, Frax Finance will provide incentives for liquidity providers in a Legacy FRAX/frxUSD Curve pool for a minimum of one year. This will allow users to migrate between the two assets at market-based rates with minimal slippage as well potential other pairs per team discretion.

FXB Redemption Path Update & Continued Incentives

Frax Bonds (FXBs) initiated on the Fraxtal Network that were converted to pay out in frxUSD upon maturity during

FIP-419 will now revert to Legacy FRAX as the redemption asset. This is being proposed for frxUSD compliance for payment stablecoin legislation as there cannot be any source of frxUSD minting outside of the legislative pathways backed by regulated assets custodied in compliant structure.

This applies specifically to the following FXB instruments: FXB2025, FXB2027, FXB2029, and FXB2055.

This update aligns with the broader objective of fully isolating frxUSD from AMO-originated debt instruments, maintaining a clear separation between the onchain and regulated, offchain monetary systems.

It also ensures that the Legacy FRAX model continues to fulfill its redemption obligations in a consistent and sustainable manner with support from Frax DAO core team.

FXBs will continue to be supported long-term within the Frax ecosystem.

While they will redeem into Legacy FRAX for now, the intention is to back future FXB issuances with

RWA-based collateral once legal and technical infrastructure is in place.

As an interim measure, FXBs will redeem into Legacy FRAX, with a future governance proposal expected to outline a pathway to migrate FXBs to a fully RWA-backed structure.

Establishment of Independent sfrxUSD Architecture & Strategy

This proposal affirms that sfrxUSD operates on a fully separate balance sheet isolated from both Legacy FRAX and frxUSD reserve assets. Its yield strategy is designed to optimize returns through governance-approved mechanisms.

Independent Accounting: All sfrxUSD liabilities and assets are tracked separately from other Frax systems. frxUSD-Denominated Operations: Since Frax Finance will no longer mint new frxUSD directly, the sfrxUSD vault operates solely using frxUSD deposited by users, with no external issuance. This deposited frxUSD may be used/unwound/redeposited for other approved activities with the end goal being more yield for sfrxUSD.

Redeemability: Although sfrxUSD follows the ERC-4626 interface, it will not be fully redeemable at all times. Under no conditions will there be new frxUSD minted into sfrxUSD nor sfrxUSD redemptions guaranteed in any way if there are losses in yield strategies & AMOs. A core team managed frxUSD buffer will be held in the sfrxUSD mint/redeem contract vault and managed by sfrxUSD AMOs, with the majority of capital actively deployed. However, deep protocol-owned liquidity (POL) for sfrxUSD ensures price stability and exit options even when direct redemption is temporarily unavailable due to allocated yield strategies. Lastly, most yield strategies will likely be fairly liquid such as Lending AMOs, Curve POL strategies, and carry trade yield through partnership with Ethena & Superstate. These strategies generally have liquidity unwinding in a matter of hours or days at latest.

Governance-Guided Yield Strategy: Yield will be generated through three approved methods:

IORB / T-Bills (held as idle frxUSD with full yield distribution to sfrxUSD)

AMOs (Lending AMOs in Fraxlend, Resupply, Aave, Morpho)

Carry Trades (through holding Ethena USDe and Superstate USCC)

Benchmark-Rate Targeting: Designed to track or exceed TradFi benchmark yields through dynamic reallocation.

Transparent Reporting: Strategy allocations and APYs will be published via Frax dashboards.

Modular Expansion: Additional strategies or protocol integrations may be added through future governance votes. # Additional Notes

Legacy FRAX Dollar will remain active, liquid, and usable across DeFi protocols and chains and supported by Frax DAO core team with incentives and utility for at least one year.

This proposal does not affect the usability or redeemability of frxUSD for fiat through FinresPBC/FRAX Inc or authorized enshrined custodian.

Summary

This proposal seeks to establish joint incentivization for a Curve liquidity pool pairing Zivoe’s new vault token (zveUSD) with frxUSD, while also laying the groundwork for future collaboration between Frax and Zivoe.

Background & Motivation

Zivoe ( https://zivoe.com/ ) is a real-world asset credit protocol launched in September 2024 that connects on-chain liquidity to consumer lenders for the purpose of funding off-chain consumer loans. Zivoe’s portfolio currently generates a 17% APR (excluding governance token emissions), making it one of the highest-yield projects in the RWA space. The Zivoe team has been longtime believers / users in the Frax ecosystem and have held FXS for years. Our team comes from top financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and more, as well as DeFi-native individuals from top protocols such as Maple Finance.

Zivoe Head of Risk - Walt Ramsey:

Walt Ramsey - Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, United States | Professional Profile | LinkedIn

With our team’s extensive background in consumer credit, we bring a deep understanding of the space, making us uniquely qualified to manage risk in this segment. Multiple members of our team have run profitable multi-billion dollar consumer lending portfolios in the past. Our underwriting partner utilizes a proprietary underwriting model that takes into account credit scores, alternative credit sources, banking information, fraud detection mechanisms, and other relevant attributes. Zivoe’s off-chain lending partner is well-capitalized and maintains provisions for potential losses to ensure portfolios remain profitable.

The protocol currently relies on a two-tranche system with two separate tranche tokens that correspond to each tranche. The value of these tokens is backed by an off-chain SPV of consumer loans. Starting in late Q2 / early Q3, Zivoe will be migrating to a uni-tranche system that utilizes the ERC-4626 standard.

Proposal Details:

Initial Pool Structure

We propose the joint incentivization by both Zivoe and Frax for a zveUSD (Zivoe’s new vault token) and frxUSD liquidity pool on Curve. This pool will utilize the StableSwap implementation, targeting a total size of $500K. Zivoe depositors will contribute up to $250K in zveUSD, while Frax community members will provide frxUSD liquidity.

Zivoe and Frax will agree to incentivize the pool for an initial one-year period. Upon the sunset of this period, both parties may elect to continue incentivizing the pool or discontinue incentives.

Token Incentives

Zivoe will initially allocate 25,000 ZVE (0.1% of the total supply), the protocol’s governance and utility token, to incentivize deposits into the pool. Based on Zivoe’s most recent funding round, this equates to $50k in ZVE.

Frax will incentivize the pool with FXTL points (and/or FXS), and Curve gauge voting to direct CRV emissions.

Strategic Benefits

Provides Frax with a gateway to gain exposure to the $1.5 trillion consumer credit market in the United States through a regulated lending structure, and further establishes frxUSD as an early mover in the rapidly evolving RWA sector.

Future Integration

Zivoe will also begin accepting frxUSD as a deposit asset, explore denominating future loans in frxUSD, and work with the Frax team to explore other ways that Zivoe can further integrate into the Frax ecosystem to contribute to the growth of Frax.

Vote Outcomes

For: Approve joint incentivization of a zveUSD / frxUSD StableSwap liquidity pool on Curve. Zivoe depositors will provide up to $250K in zveUSD, and Frax community members will provide frxUSD liquidity. Frax will incentivize the pool with FXTL points (and/or FXS), and Curve gauge voting to direct CRV emissions. Zivoe will allocate 25,000 ZVE to support frxUSD deposits. The pool will be incentivized for an initial one-year period, with the option to extend.

Summary 2.1

This proposal seeks to implement the upgrading of FXS, the Frax North Star Hardfork, the Tail Emission Plan, and the Flox Capacitor Boost. The proposal includes:

Renaming of the original FRAX token to: Legacy Frax Dollar.

Renaming of FXS to FRAX: will unify branding efforts and reduce confusion.

Renaming of veFXS to veFRAX: in line with the other renamings.

North Star Hardfork: FRAX (prev. FXS) will become the gas token on Fraxtal, replacing frxETH. It will also facilitate setting up ETH2-like validators in a future update later. This will provide even more utility for the FRAX (prev. FXS) token.

Tail Emission Plan: Introduces 8% yearly FRAX (prev. FXS) emissions, dropping 1% a year to a floor of 3% in 5 years. These will be directed to FXTL point conversions, community discretionary, DAO discretionary, and team retention.

Flox Capacitor (floxCAP) Boost: A new boosting system designed so users can boost their FXTL conversion rate by locking FRAX (prev. FXS) into a special FRAX staking contract with a fixed 90 day cooldown for withdrawal. veFRAX balances will also qualify for the floxCAP boost.

FXTL Conversion: Every week, ~2% of a user’s FXTL will be converted to FRAX. Conversion rate depends on the user’s floxCAP. Total sum of all FRAX released for conversions subject to tail emission plan.

Proposal Details

Renaming of tokens & multi-chain strategy

While we realize these rebrandings might initially cause minor confusion, in the interest of branding and frxUSD expansion efforts, we propose that: “Legacy” FRAX (the original stablecoin) will be renamed to Legacy Frax Dollar

The current FRAX logo will replace the FXS logo: (the FXS logo will not be used anywhere going forward)

FXS will be renamed to FRAX. FRAX will continue to govern emissions, revenue-sharing, gauge emissions, and protocol incentives, reinforcing Frax’s decentralized economic model. veFXS will be renamed to veFRAX

Full Usability of Legacy Tokens: The FXS token (now renamed to FRAX) will remain fully usable across the Frax ecosystem and supported protocols and chains, ensuring continuity for all existing integrations and holders. FXS can upgrade 1 to 1 to FRAX on Fraxtal chain at any time.

Multi-Chain Strategy Based on OFT Standard: FRAX will continue its multi-chain expansion and will be aligned with the LayerZero OFT standard. This currently includes Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Blast, BSC, Fraxtal, Ink, Metis, Mode, Optimism, Polygon, Polygon-zkEVM, Sei, Sonic, and X-Layer. Future chains include Move, Solana, and TON.

North Star Hardfork

FRAX (prev. FXS) will become the gas token for Fraxtal, replacing frxETH.

The current FRAX (prev. FXS) contract will change to a WETH-like gas wrapper contract called wFRAX.

Any holders of FXS ERC20s will receive 1:1 wFRAX ERC20 tokens. They can choose to unwrap it for FRAX gas or keep it as an ERC20. Thus, users who hold FXS on Fraxtal will not need to do any action to upgrade their token, the token upgrade will be done for them in the North Star Hardfork. wfrxETH will become frxETH and will be changed to a normal ERC20. wfrxETH holders will receive 1:1 of frxETH ERC20 tokens.

Because of gas handling / payable-ness in smart contracts, EOAs & Safes will be treated differently than LP/DeFi contracts as follows:

Due to character limitation for Snapshot proposals please find this section on forum post here

Additional misc system contract changes will be made to facilitate an ETH2-like validator system in the future, where instead of ETH, FRAX (prev. FXS) would be staked.

Details & Comparison:

Due to character limitation for Snapshot proposals please find this section on forum post here

FXTL points conversion

Every week, there will be (1 / 52.1429 = ~1.918%) * (3M FRAX allocated for FXTL conversion from tail emission plan) = 57534.2 FRAX available for conversion.

Every week, 1 / 52.1429 = ~1.918% of a user’s FXTL point balance will be deducted / burned and automatically converted to claimable FRAX.

The conversion rate depends on each user, depending on their floxCAP balance and veFRAX balance+lock duration (delegation possible). If other users also have a high floxCAP balance, they will all have lesser conversion rates due to competition (e.g. normalization). This is similar to how the current gauge farms work. Specific formula TBD.

The total sum of FRAX converted per week will not exceed 57534.2 tokens. That is why the rates need to be normalized in iii.

For tax / other purposes, users can claim the actual FRAX when they choose. It will not be automatically airdropped into their addresses.

FXTL Points as Primary Incentives on Fraxtal: FXTL points will continue to serve as the main incentive mechanism for expanding the Fraxtal ecosystem, ensuring robust growth and alignment with protocol objectives. Because points are allocated in different amounts for different activities and will be expanded over time to include a growing ecosystem of projects and builders on the Fraxtal chain.

Flox Capacitor (floxCAP) Boost Mechanism:

Lock FRAX (prev.FXS) into a FRAX staking contract to multiply the amount of weekly tokens up for conversion that you would normally be entitled to without the boost. You can withdraw your FRAX from this contract any time based on a fixed cooldown period of 90 days.

In order to receive the boost, you will have to maintain a certain threshold floxCAP balance relative to your entitled FRAX token conversion amount that week, otherwise you will be able to convert your points to the normal baseline amount. If you choose to not stake FRAX for the floxCAP boost, you can still earn tokens at the baseline conversion amount.

The formula for calculating this threshold ratio will be determined at a later time, but is expected to depend on multiple factors, including the total FXTL emitted for all users for that week, as well as the total amount of floxCAP boost held by other users “Cappers.” An additional boost will also come from the user’s veFRAX balance which can be delegated for ease of use. This boost will have a cliff stake duration of likely around 2 years so only long veFRAX lockers are eligible.

Withdrawing your floxCAP back into FRAX (prev. FXS) will be a fixed staking+cooldown system of 90 days. floxCAP is non-transferable. floxCap is a balance signifying boosting power of a user’s wallet/address.

This system will reward long-term oriented users without imposing exceedingly long locking periods of veFRAX which has more powerful governance+rev share functionality and a FXTL boost. It will also reduce FRAX (prev. FXS) selling from points conversions since getting the best conversion rate requires owning+staking FRAX for at least the next 90 days.

Summary

This proposal seeks to introduce the WisdomTree Government Money Market Digital Fund (“WTGXX” or “Fund”) as an on-chain, reserve (backing) asset for Frax USD with exposure to U.S. dollar yield.

WTGXX is a tokenized money market digital fund, regulated under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”), designed to provide investors with a high level of current income consistent with preservation of capital and liquidity and the maintenance of a stable $1.00 net asset value (“NAV”) per share. The securities purchased by the Fund are subject to the quality, diversification, and other requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the1940 Act, and other rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). This product can be utilized by crypto-native institutions and investors to support the reserves of stable assets.

Benefits of utilizing WTGXX as a reserve backing asset:

Competitive Yield via U.S. Treasury and government securities exposure

U.S. Regulatory Compliance, Transparency, and Standardization

1940-Act Fund Structure and Bankruptcy Remoteness

Liquidity and Redemption Efficiency and Optionality (primary market mint/redeem and peer-to-peer transactions)

Institutional-grade investment platform

Partnering with industry leaders – including Voya Investment Management, Fireblocks, and Bank of New York

Proposal Details

General Overview:

WTGXX invests in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury and government securities. Such securities may include: U.S. Treasury Notes (both fixed and floating rate), U.S. T-Bills, U.S. Government Agency Notes, including Discount Notes, that are either fixed or floating rate and issued by government agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Bank System, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the Federal Farm Credit Bank. The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements collateralized fully by U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government Agency securities or cash. The Fund may also invest in other investment companies that are government money market funds to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).

The Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in government securities and repurchase agreements that are collateralized by government securities.

The securities purchased by the Fund are subject to the quality, diversification, and other requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the1940 Act, and other rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Please see the Prospectus and SAI (see supplementary documents) for additional information, including additional strategy information and risk factors.

As an ERC-20 token, digital representations of WTGXX’s shares can be maintained by any wallet provider that operates on the Ethereum public blockchain. The tokenized shares of WTGXX are expected to soon be available natively on Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, and Optimism.

As of 3/4/2025, cumulative AUM across chains is $112.32M. Additionally, as of 3/4/2025, WTGXX has processed over 8,300 transactions with over $114.5M in total volume.

Fee Considerations:

The expense ratio is 0.25%. There are no transaction, subscription or minting fees or other service fees. Investors are responsible for gas fees for their transfers of tokens to another wallet, such as utilizing USDC via the Stablecoin Conversion Service and potentially stablecoin burn fees.

Fees and Expenses of the Fund

The following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy, hold, and sell shares of the Fund. The fees are expressed as a percentage of the Fund’s average net assets.

Other notes:

All fees are described above and in the Fund’s Prospectus. Unlike many other types of investment vehicles and funds, which may charge investors a variety of “other” expenses, the Adviser provides investment advisory services and pays the Fund’s operating expenses in return for a “unitary fee”, and pays such other expenses, with certain limited exceptions.

Secondary market transfers or sales may incur gas fees and are subject to potential price fluctuations, including premiums or discounts, which can be unpredictable.

Executive Summary

The Janus Henderson Anemoy Treasury Fund (formerly Anemoy LTF) has successfully passed governance in being accepted as collateral for FRAX via

FIP-308 as of early 2024.

This proposal seeks to formally approve JTRSY as a custodian asset for frxUSD as the protocol enables a enshrined custodian model. JTRSY was recently given a

A+ rating from Particula , and a

AA rating from Moodys , the highest ratings ever given to a tokenized offering.

Additionally, Centrifuge uniquely has the ability to mint RWAs on Fraxtal with a deployment on the network. Any Centrifuge tokenized RWA used to back frxUSD, will be done so attributing TVL to Fraxtal with Centrifuge launching on the chain.

Background and Motivation

Frax USD (frxUSD) aims to attract billions in investment by serving as a fully collateralized, fiat-equivalent asset. It is supported by a diversified pool of stable, income-generating assets which the protocol can dynamically rebalance according to the most advantageous asset allocation strategy tailored to current market conditions.

In its mission to offer savings products to investors, Frax can leverage Centrifuge to access a range of yield opportunities, enabling Frax to fine-tune its investment exposure irrespective of prevailing interest rate conditions. Centrifuge enabling high quality real-world assets on Fraxtal aligns with Fraxtal's mission to own the full DeFi value chain on the network.

JTRSY (formerly LTF) is issued by Anemoy, the asset management arm of Centrifuge. Anemoy recently partnered with Janus Henderson ($360B AUM), in which Janus Henderson formally became the investment manager of the fund under the Janus Henderson Anemoy Treasury Fund name.

Centrifuge is a pioneering tokenization protocol founded in 2017, and recognized for coining the term ""Real-World Assets"". Centrifuge is uniquely issuer-agnostic, jurisdiction-agnostic, and asset-agnostic, seamlessly integrating into the decentralized finance ecosystem. Centrifuge is an open-source protocol governed and operated by a decentralized autonomous organization . Centrifuge has successfully financed over $680 million worth of assets as of February 2025, establishing itself as a leader in the RWA space.

Anemoy serves an asset management firm powered by Centrifuge technology, founded in 2023 by co-founders Martin Quensel and Anil Sood. Anemoy was established with a clear mission: to advance Centrifuge's efforts in developing RWA products tailored specifically for bridging the TradFi and DeFi worlds.

Janus Henderson Investors (JHI) , a leader in traditional finance managing over $360 billion in assets, will serve as sub-advisor to the Fund. Janus Henderson is a British-American global asset management group headquartered in London. Anemoy benefits from their expertise in Fixed Income and Alternatives.

JTRSY Overview

The Janus Henderson Anemoy Treasury Fund (JTRSY) will seek to provide a liquid, low risk portfolio through exposure to U.S Treasury Bills (T-bills) with maturities of between 0-3 months. The portfolio is carefully structured to manage yield curve, duration, and liquidity risks.

JTRSY was recently given a

A+ rating from Particula , and a

AA rating from Moodys , the highest ratings ever given to a tokenized offering. Notably, LTF is also currently undergoing a rating from S&P Global Ratings.

Fees for JTRSY are 25bps annually in the form of a management fee. Fees are automatically withheld from the NAV of the fund on a daily basis. There are no other fees associated with the fund.

Liquidity

JTRSY offers standard t+1 redemptions during banking days. However, recent advancements within the fund will soon allow JTRSY to be redeemed for USDC intraday/instantly.

The following chart demonstrates the standard redemption process.

Anemoy has strategically secured partnerships for liquidity vehicles and risk management, with a focus on addressing both the immediate needs and future state of DeFi. This solution is called the Anemoy Liquidity Network (ALN) and includes $100M+ in instant redemption capabilities.

For both instant redemption facilities, an instant redemption contract will be deployed that enables JTRSY holders to lock JTRSY fund shares, which can then be swapped for USDC by the liquidity partners, at predetermined fees. The swaps will be executed at the latest fund share price provided by the Chronicle RWA oracle.

Legal

The Fund is established as a BVI professional fund. This legal structure provides the best possible investor protection of any tokenized treasury product currently available.

The BVI professional fund structure provides direct recourse for investors to the segregated and ring-fenced assets of the Liquid Treasury Fund (i.e., US T-Bills and USD cash) in case of liquidation of the Fund.

Importantly, this direct recourse is enshrined in law rather than a mere contractual right.

This structure is more advantageous for investors than other tokenized treasury products such as SPV/debt offerings or exempt US 3(c)(7) funds.

Detailed Holdings

The Centrifuge app, including the

Fund , offers investors unparalleled transparency by providing detailed insights into the individual assets held by the fund. Investors can view their holdings, Fund activities, returns, and overall fund composition in near real-time via the Centrifuge platform.

Our collaboration with Trident Trust further enhances the accuracy and efficiency of our reporting. Together, we publish an onchain record of portfolio data and net asset valuations, ensuring that all financial records are transparent, up-to-date, and accessible to investors at any time.

Transparency is a core value of Centrifuge. In the

Assets tab , investors can see the individual Treasury Bills held by the Fund, with the CUSIP, Market Value, Realized & Unrealized P&L and the portfolio weighting per asset.

For each asset, investors can find all the asset details (including ISIN, issue date and maturity date) as well as key performance metrics such as Yield to Maturity, Market Value and Realized and Unrealized P&L on the dashboard. This is unique to the Centrifuge platform and provides unparalleled transparency in reporting.

The image below shows a detailed view of an individual Treasury Bill security.

Launching on Fraxtal

Centrifuge employs a unique architecture that allows it to issue RWAs on any EVM compatible chain, including the Fraxtal network. Investors on Centrifuge can choose to mint their RWAs on their preferred chain which Centrifuge supports.

Any RWAs used to back frxUSD will be minted on Fraxtal to further enhance community alignment and attribute more TVL to the Frax ecosystem.

With the introduction of

Centrifuge V3 , not only will issuers be able to launch pools on Fraxtal attributing TVL to the network, but asset managers will be able to natively manage RWA pools on Fraxtal as well.

This is a large opportunity for Fraxtal to be a home for RWAs, by both backing frxUSD with RWAs on Fraxtal, as well as growing Fraxtal RWAs within the DeFi ecosystem more broadly.

Users deposit ETH which is staked on the Beacon Chain and then restaked with a restaking platform like Eigenlayer. Users receive ynETH representing a tradable and liquid token receipt of its underlying ETH.

Auto compounding rewards are sourced from Ethereum staking, AVSs, and airdrops. Rewards are accrued in the ynETH contract, thereby increasing the pool’s total value and increasing the value of ynETH (i.e. non-rebasing).

Why Adding ynETH to Fraxlend is Beneficial:

Adding ynETH to Fraxlend enhances capital efficiency, boosts TVL, diversifies lending markets, and fosters ecosystem growth, benefiting both protocols and their users.

Redemption Mechanisms:

The redemption mechanism currently uses an asynchronous withdrawal queue, which is subject to a delay of approximately less than or equal to the withdrawal delay of the underlying collateral from Eigenlayer (7 days) + Beconchain que. ynETH Withdrawal Overview

Users call requestWithdrawal()for the amount of ynETH they want to redeem. The ynETH amount is transferred to the WithdrawalQueueManager and a corresponding NFT is minted that contains a unique ID, the amount being withdrawn, the withdrawal fee, the redemption rate, and the request timestamp. The NFT is not bound to an address but cannot be canceled.

After all waiting periods have elapsed, sufficient funds are available and the withdrawal has been processed the user can claim their funds with their NFT ID. Claiming burns the ynETH and the corresponding NFT, with the redeemed funds being sent to the user's address.

Faster alternative redemption methods include swapping ynETH on secondary sites such as AMMs e.g. Curve or selling a claim NFT to another party prepared to wait.

Oracle Type ynETH utilizes market-based oracles provided by Pyth, eOracle, and Ojo.

We currently have Chainlink price feeds deployed on Base and Optimism, which are aligned with our protocol-provided rate, and we plan to expand to the mainnet as well. Additionally, we have deployed a Curve oracle. It would be ideal to leverage the Curve oracle like Curve Lend.

Superstate Inc., the Investment Manager on behalf of Superstate Short Duration US Government Securities Fund (USTB)

Summary

This proposal seeks to introduces USTB, Superstate's Short Duration US Government Securities Fund, delivering stability, liquidity, and Treasury Bill yield as reserves behind the stablecoin.

USTB is a tokenized (ERC-20) fund offering investors access to short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills. USTB’s investment objective is to seek current income as is consistent with liquidity and stability of principal, targeting returns in line with the federal funds rate.

USTB has daily liquidity, low management fees, no performance fee, transparent holdings, institutional custody, bankruptcy-remote structure, and crypto-native features that make it appealing as an asset behind Frax USD.

This proposal looks to introduce USTB as a collateral asset with an initial cap of $100mm.

Background and Motivation [Please Check out the forum post for this section]

USTB Overview

USTB delivers T-Bill exposure for Frax by investing in short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills and targets return in line with the federal funds rate. Ownership in the Fund is issued as a yield-bearing ERC-20 token, USTB, or in the book-entry form. USTB is freely transferable between Ethereum addresses on the Allowlist. Purchases and redemptions are facilitated through USD or USDC, with liquidity each market day.

USTB has been selected through robust and rigorous RFP processes to provide compliant asset management solutions for crypto-native stablecoins and projects. Leveraging Superstate’s team’s deep expertise in DeFi, we have developed compliant asset management products that make managing and issuing digital assets secure and easy. To date, USTB is used to power the following projects:

Mountain's USDM

M^0 “M” Stablecoin

Ethena’s USDe Reserve Fund

Arbitrum’s Treasury

Beyond this, USTB is currently being evaluated as a yield source for Polygon’s PoS Bridge Assets and for reserves of Sky’s USDS. Additionally, USTB supports digital asset teams in many capacities such as a cash management tool or treasury assets.

Investment Mandate

USTB’s investment mandate ensures at least 95% of the portfolio is invested in short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills. Up to 5% of the portfolio at any time can be held in cash to facilitate liquidity; however, given the highly liquid nature of the portfolio, cash positions are kept at a minimum at all times. Additionally, USTB’s mandate is to maintain an average portfolio duration of one year or less.

The Fund is sub-advised by [Federated Hermes  , an ~$800B AUM asset manager. The majority of the assets they manage are deployed in Money Market strategies. Susan Hill, CFA is the Portfolio Manager responsible for executing the Fund’s mandate. She brings three decades of investing experience managing assets for institutions and is specifically responsible for overseeing ~$300B in fixed-income assets.

Income

USTB generates income through 24/7/365 interest accrual via Continuous Pricing, ensuring Frax begins earning interest immediately and continues accruing until redemption. This method allows interest to accumulate 24/7 and provides real-time, on-chain visibility of the stablecoin's backing value, offering a more crypto-friendly alternative to monthly dividends.

Income is realized through USTB shares, issued as a yield-bearing ERC-20 token, USTB token, or Book Entry shares. Each USTB token represents one share in USTB, with the number of shares minted based on the Purchase Amount divided by the Net Asset Value per share (NAV/S) on Market Days.

The NAV/S starts at $10 and increases continuously, reflecting the Fund's accruing interest. NAV/S is calculated by the reputable third-party, NAV Fund Services. Investors can redeem USTB for USDC or its USD equivalent based on the current NAV/S value.

USTB Investor Eligibility

USTB is only open to Qualified Purchasers who must be KYC’d. Finres has already been deemed eligible to invest in this fund.

KYC/AML Compliance and Whitelist

The Fund and USTB tokens are available to ""whitelisted"" (aka Allowlist) investors who have passed checks for the suitability, AML/KYC verification, and register their corresponding addresses. Only the whitelisted users can subscribe for or acquire tokens on the secondary market. The Allowlist address check is part of the USTB token’s code and occurs each time a transaction is attempted. If the receiving or sending address is not present on the Allowlist, the transaction will fail.

Tokens

Ownership in the Fund are issued as a yield-bearing ERC-20 token, USTB, on Ethereum or in Book Entry (not tokenized) form. USTB is freely transferable between Ethereum addresses on the Allowlist. Purchases and redemptions are facilitated through USD or USDC, with liquidity each market day.

Legal / Operational Details

Legal Structure

USTB is a separate series of Superstate Asset Trust (a Delaware Statutory Trust). USTB is a private fund pursuant to Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. USTB is only available to a limited subset of potential investors that meet the criteria outlined in the Private Placement Memorandum. Investors must undergo AML, KYC, and sanctions compliance checks.

USTB is bankruptcy-remote from Superstate Inc. as a separate Series of Superstate Asset Trust, a Delaware Statutory Trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (“DSTA”). This structure ensures that shareholders’ investments are both separate from Superstate Inc.'s balance sheet and are siloed from other series.

Fund Mechanics

Investors may purchase Shares of USTB via USDC or USD (“cash”) which may be issued in the form of ERC-20 tokens. This tokenized ownership is composable and transferable where one Share is represented by one USTB token on Ethereum. Transferring the USTB token effectively transfers ownership of the underlying share of the Fund. Investors who complete onboarding may identify Ethereum addresses to an AllowList, a smart contract managed by Superstate Inc. that approves KYC’d entities to interact with USTB tokens.

NAV/S per second (also available onchain via Chainlink), transparent holdings, yield, and more are available via the Investor Portal or by visiting USTB's Fund page.

Superstate Inc., the Investment Manager on behalf of Superstate Crypto Carry Fund (USCC)

Summary

This proposal seeks to introduce USCC (Superstate Crypto Carry Fund) as collateral backing Frax USD (frxUSD), delivering stability, liquidity, and market-neutral yield as reserves behind the stablecoin.

USCC is a tokenized (ERC-20) crypto cash and carry fund that allows decentralized stablecoins to benefit from the stability of market-neutral positions while generating market-neutral on the assets backing the stablecoin as part of a diversified portfolio.

USCC has daily liquidity, low management fees, no performance fee, transparent holdings, institutional custody, bankruptcy-remote structure, and crypto-native features that make it appealing as an asset behind Frax USD.

This proposal looks to introduce USCC as a collateral asset with an initial cap of $20mm.

Background and Motivations [Please Check out the forum post for this section]

USCC Overview

For years, the crypto cash-and-carry trade has been one of the best risk-adjusted opportunities, consistently producing double-digit returns with minimal directional market exposure.

Despite volatile swings and the operational complexity of setting up this trade, the potential returns are extremely attractive. Consistent yield generation in a crypto basis requires active management and has historically only been accessible to highly sophisticated investors, until now.

Spreads between spot and future prices for an asset create opportunities for investors to exploit. Basis (or ‘cash-and-carry’) trades involve an investor buying an asset (long leg) and shorting the corresponding future (short leg), or the reverse. These offsetting positions reduce directional market exposure and, if held to expiry, generate a predictable return as the two legs converge.

In crypto, liquid futures markets exist in both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), providing ample opportunity for crypto basis trading. In addition, long Ether positions can be staked to generate additional yield on deployed capital.

However, in order to execute this strategy effectively, investors need multiple counterparties and have to regularly monitor positions. Frax benefits from investing in USCC to get exposure to this market neutral yield strategy to optimize the reserves and yield backing frxUSD.

Flexible and market-neutral, USCC's investment strategy optimizes the yield and risk of crypto cash-and-carry trades.

Leveraging Superstate’s deep crypto markets expertise, USCC allocates capital to the best risk-adjusted opportunities at any time across:

Bitcoin basis

Ether basis, including staking Ether

Cash and Treasury Bill products, and

Basis in crypto commodities approved by CFTC in the future

When the crypto basis is meaningfully above the Federal Funds Rate, USCC will allocate accordingly. Otherwise, USCC will invest in Treasury Bill products until the next material opportunity is presented. As the basis changes, the Fund will adjust exposures and can trade backwardation if the futures curve inverts (e.g. when spot price > futures price).

USCC does not use leverage.

USCC is a simple, transparent, and compliant product for qualified purchasers to access crypto basis.

Investors can subscribe to and redeem from the Fund in USD or USDC, and shares can either be held in book-entry form or be tokenized as an ERC-20 token, which will, in the future, enable transfers between other shareholders for collateral or settlement purposes.

USCC is U.S.-based and structured as a bankruptcy-remote private fund. All trades are executed through top-tier domestic Prime Brokers, and assets are custodied by Anchorage Digital Bank (when spot is not held as margin with a Prime Broker). USCC is also audited annually by Ernst & Young, and NAV Fund Services produces the daily NAV (displayed publicly on the USCC fund page) and monthly statements. See 'Service Provider' overview below for more details.

Frax Core Team

Summary

This proposal seeks to launch

Frax USD (frxUSD) and

Staked Frax USD (sfrxUSD) as new components of the Frax Finance ecosystem. Frax USD represents a modernized, modular stablecoin aligned with Frax Finance’s vision of decentralization, stability, and usability. Staked Frax USD will function as the yield-bearing counterpart to Frax USD, offering users opportunities to earn consistent returns through integration with strategic partners. Additionally, the proposal aims to provide a structured upgrade pathway to transition current Frax stablecoin holders to the enhanced Frax USD framework.

Background and Motivation

Frax Finance has long been recognized as a leader in decentralized stablecoins, establishing itself as a trusted and innovative protocol. With over $600M in market cap , Frax's current stablecoin, FRAX, has been a pillar of the DeFi ecosystem. However, as the market evolves and competition intensifies, it is imperative to adapt and grow.

The transition from FRAX to frxUSD reflects Frax Finance's commitment to innovation and its readiness to meet the demands of a broader audience. Frax USD aligns itself with global familiarity and positions itself as a trusted and recognizable option for stable value storage and transactions.

The savings vault product, sFRAX, will seamlessly upgrade to sfrxUSD, continuing to offer unparalleled risk-adjusted yields. Frax Finance will leverage its extensive DeFi strategies and ecosystem flexibility to maintain its position as a leader in stablecoin yields.

Proposal Details

Key Features and Partnerships

Frax USD (frxUSD)

Direct Fiat Redemptions: frxUSD will enable users to seamlessly convert their holdings into fiat currency through a partnership with Paxos. This feature bridges the gap between DeFi and traditional finance, making frxUSD more accessible and practical for everyday use.

Federal Reserve Access: Frax Finance, through its strategic partner FinresPBC, is working to establish direct access to a US Federal Reserve Master Account (FMA). This would elevate frxUSD to become the most secure stablecoin available, offering unmatched trust and stability to its users.

T-Bill Integration: Leveraging FinresPBC's existing access to T-Bills, frxUSD will be further supported by robust collateral, reinforcing its reliability and expanding its use case.

Staked Frax USD (sfrxUSD)

Competitive Yields: sfrxUSD utilizes diverse DeFi strategies to provide consistently high yields, ensuring users can maximize their returns on staked assets.

Adaptability: The vault is designed to adjust dynamically to changing market conditions, ensuring that yield opportunities remain sustainable and aligned with Frax Finance’s goals.

Upgrade Pathway

To ensure a smooth and user-friendly transition to the updated frxUSD and sfrxUSD tokens, Frax Finance will implement the following upgrade pathway:

FRAX and sFRAX on Fraxtal:

FRAX stablecoins and sFRAX yielding stablecoins held on Fraxtal will be upgraded to frxUSD and sfrxUSD seamlessly in a routine OP stack hard fork. The token addresses will remain identical and not change. No action is required by users holding FRAX and sFRAX tokens on

Fraxtal .

FRAX and sFRAX on chains that are using LayerZero OFT tokens:

FRAX stablecoins and sFRAX yielding stablecoins held on the following chains using LayerZero OFT tokens will be upgraded to frxUSD and sfrxUSD seamlessly through a contract upgrade. No action is required by users holding FRAX and sFRAX tokens on:

Sei, Mode, and X Layer .

FRAX and sFRAX on Ethereum:

FRAX stablecoins and sFRAX yielding stablecoins held on Ethereum will be allowed to upgrade to frxUSD and sfrxUSD 1-to-1 at any time through an upgrade contract. Both FRAX and sFRAX tokens will continue to function as normal indefinitely and retain their ability to upgrade 1-to-1 at any time in the future so all DeFi protocols integrating either legacy token can continue to function without disruption.

FRAX and sFRAX on chains that are using Frax Ferry:

FRAX stablecoins and sFRAX yielding stablecoins held on the following chains using the Frax Ferry system will be allowed to upgrade to frxUSD and sfrxUSD 1-to-1 at any time through an upgrade contract. The chains are as follows:

Arbitrum, BSC, Optimism, Avalanche, Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, zkSync, and Tron . Both FRAX and sFRAX tokens will continue to function as normal indefinitely and retain their ability to upgrade 1-to-1 at any time in the future so all DeFi protocols integrating either legacy token can continue to function without disruption.

Important Notes frxUSD Backing:

All newly upgraded frxUSD stablecoins will be backed by stablecoin tokens (USDe, USDC, sDAI), CDPs in Fraxlend, and cash equivalent RWA assets from custodians.

Securitize Markets, LLC, as placement agent for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund Ltd. (“BUIDL”)

Summary

This proposal seeks to introduce BUIDL - the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund Ltd. - as an on-chain, backing asset for Frax USD with exposure to U.S. dollar yield.

BUIDL is a tokenized U.S. Treasury product designed to provide decentralized organizations and other institutional investors a blockchain-based investment solution that can be used alongside other investments as a reserve backing of stable assets.

Benefits of holding BUIDL as a reserve backing asset may include:

Yield generation

Multiple options to transfer

Minimized counterparty risk via industry leaders - Securitize, BlackRock, and Bank of New York Mellon

Background and Motivation [Please Check out the forum post for this section]

Proposal Details

General Overview:

BUIDL will invest 100% of its total assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Treasury, and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations or cash, allowing investors to gain exposure to one of the most liquid assets. Holders benefit from a fund seeking a stable value of $1 per token and may earn any yield that is paid through daily accrued dividends issued directly to investors’ wallets as new tokens each month.

As an ERC-20 token, BUIDL can be custodied by any provider that operates on the Ethereum public blockchain. BUIDL is also available natively on Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Aptos.

The current AUM of BUIDL across all integrated chains can be found via Dune (dashboard link at the end) or RWA.xyz. As of 12/12/2024, cumulative AUM across chains is $561,536,881. Additionally, as of 12/12/2024, BUIDL has processed 620 transactions with $1.38B in total volume.

Asset Eligibility:

The Fund will invest 100% of its total assets, in both the primary and secondary markets, in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, notes, repurchase agreements, or other obligations that mature in 95 days or less from the settlement of the purchase of such securities. The Fund may invest in variable and floating rate instruments, and transact in securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis.

The Fund will only purchase securities that present minimal credit risk as determined by the

Investment Manager. The Fund may also invest in one or more government money market funds managed by the Investment Manager or an affiliate thereof that invest in the same types of securities in which the Fund may invest directly. For purposes of satisfying the Fund’s strategy of investing 100% of its total assets in cash and the other types of securities described above, investments in such Underlying BlackRock Funds will be considered as if they are invested in cash and such securities. No hedging or derivatives are permitted in the underlying portfolio.

Detailed holdings are provided to holders upon request.

Yield Considerations: [Please Check out the forum post for this section]

Fee Considerations: [Please Check out the forum post for this section]

Permissioning:

Securitize leverages its DS protocol to program asset specific compliance rules into the asset contract to enforce a permissioned environment. The DS protocol is the most widely used and long-standing protocol in the industry to issue compliant tokenized securities on public blockchains. The TA maintains an on-chain “whitelist” of fully onboarded, KYCd and authorized investor wallets able to perform allowable transfers between other whitelisted wallets and/or investors. All investors, whether transacting in the primary or secondary market, must be whitelisted by the TA before receiving or transferring BUIDL tokens.

Shares in the Fund are only being offered to and will only be issued to “professional investors” within the meaning of The Securities and Investment Business Act, 2010 (SIBA). Individual US investors are not accepted as investors of the Fund at this time.

Each investor seeking to invest in the shares must be, among other things: an “accredited investor” as defined under Regulation D; AND either:

A: “qualified purchaser” or a “knowledgeable employee,” in each case as defined under applicable U.S. federal securities laws; OR

B: Non-U.S. person that is outside the United States at the time the investor acquires the Shares.

Subscription and Redemption Overview:

BUIDL allows for several methods of subscription and redemption:

On the primary market, subscriptions to and redemptions from BUIDL are available via USD, (and if investors are clients of Zero Hash, via USDC conversion facilitated by Zero Hash).

BUIDL is available to be nearly instantly liquidated to USDC via the Circle liquidity smart contract. (2)

Whitelisted investors may also acquire or transfer BUIDL tokens through peer to peer transfers on the secondary market 24/7/265, subject to the availability from whitelisted ecosystem participants. (3)

Subscription Timing:

Column 1

Column 2

USD

Same day if USD funds are received before 2:30 pm ET on business days; next business day otherwise

USDC (4)

Issued on the business day in which USD funds are received to BNY upon USDC conversion by 2:30 PM EST

Propose the creation of a new Fraxlend pair on the Ethereum mainnet: ynETH/frxETH.

Important to read we already have a market on Curve Lend see the parameters here: https://www.llamarisk.com/research/llamalend-yneth

Details:

Fraxlend Pair Name: ynETH/frxETH - Variable Rate V2

Chain: Ethereum Mainnet

Max Authorized Allocation: 2,000,000 FRAX

Max Loan-to-Value (LTV): To be decided by the development team.

Background and Motivation:

YieldNest is a next-generation liquid restaking protocol that offers simple, high-yielding, risk-adjusted restaking and DeFi strategies across multiple protocols. Our mission is to simplify restaking and DeFi by creating a one-stop shop for easy-to-understand LRTs. These products can be created permissionless, curated, and managed by YieldNest subDAOs or external parties.

Audit -> https://docs.yieldnest.finance/security/audits

Codebase -> https://github.com/yieldnest/yieldnest-protocol

By introducing the ynETH/frxETH pair, Fraxlend can tap into the strong demand for ynETH, offering new borrowing and lending opportunities. This aligns with Fraxlend’s strategy of supporting valuable assets within the DeFi ecosystem. The development team will determine the appropriate LTV to balance risk and opportunity.

Liquidity Profile:

It is important to read we already have a market on Curve Lend see the parameters here: https://www.llamarisk.com/research/llamalend-yneth ynETH is a native Liquid Restaking Token (nLRT), that aims to maximize yield by delegating assets to a basket of EigenLayer AVSs across different verticals. Users deposit ETH which is staked on the Beacon Chain and then restaked with a restaking platform like Eigenlayer. Users receive ynETH representing a tradable and liquid token receipt of its underlying ETH.

Auto compounding rewards are sourced from Ethereum staking, AVSs, and airdrops. Rewards are accrued in the ynETH contract, thereby increasing the pool’s total value and increasing the value of ynETH (i.e. non-rebasing).

Why Adding ynETH to Fraxlend is Beneficial:

Adding ynETH to Fraxlend enhances capital efficiency, boosts TVL, diversifies lending markets, and fosters ecosystem growth, benefiting both protocols and their users.

Redemption Mechanisms:

The redemption mechanism currently uses an asynchronous withdrawal queue, which is subject to a delay of approximately less than or equal to the withdrawal delay of the underlying collateral from Eigenlayer (7 days) + Beconchain que. ynETH Withdrawal Overview

Users call requestWithdrawal()for the amount of ynETH they want to redeem. The ynETH amount is transferred to the WithdrawalQueueManager and a corresponding NFT is minted that contains a unique ID, the amount being withdrawn, the withdrawal fee, the redemption rate, and the request timestamp. The NFT is not bound to an address but cannot be canceled.

After all waiting periods have elapsed, sufficient funds are available and the withdrawal has been processed the user can claim their funds with their NFT ID. Claiming burns the ynETH and the corresponding NFT, with the redeemed funds being sent to the user's address.

Faster alternative redemption methods include swapping ynETH on secondary sites such as AMMs e.g. Curve or selling a claim NFT to another party prepared to wait.

Source: YieldNest Docs - ynETH withdrawals

Oracle Type ynETH utilizes market-based oracles provided by Pyth, eOracle, and Ojo.

We currently have Chainlink price feeds deployed on Base and Optimism, which are aligned with our protocol-provided rate, and we plan to expand to the mainnet as well. Additionally, we have deployed a Curve oracle. It would be ideal to leverage the Curve oracle like Curve Lend.

[FIP - 416] Authorizing FRAX Curve AMO for a new pair on Fraxtal (FRAX/dUSD),[FIP - 416] Authorizing FRAX Curve AMO for a new pair on Fraxtal (FRAX/dUSD),"Dec 10, 2024 · 8:45 AM","Dec 10, 2024 · 8:45 AM","Dec 15, 2024 · 8:45 AM","I. Summary

This proposal seeks liquidity support from Frax’s Curve AMO for a Fraxtal pool between FRAX and dUSD (FRAX/dUSD). dUSD is dTRINITY’s protocol-native stablecoin, fully-backed by an onchain reserve of other whitelisted stablecoins and yieldcoins (e.g., FRAX, DAI, sFRAX, sDAI). Users can mint 1 dUSD permissionlessly by locking $1 of reserve asset in its smart contract.

In preparation for dTRINITY’s December mainnet launch on Fraxtal, we propose authorizing the Frax AMO to allocate $2,000,000 in initial liquidity support for the FRAX/dUSD pool, with half in FRAX and half in dUSD. This will help bootstrap early liquidity for dUSD on Fraxtal, enabling lenders and borrowers from dTRINITY to swap dUSD efficiently with FRAX and other FRAX-paired assets on Curve.

Additionally, dTRINITY will authorize $2,000,000 in initial liquidity from its own AMO to support and scale the pool as needed.

II. Background & Motivation dTRINITY is the first subsidized lending protocol in DeFi to offer stablecoin loans with interest rebates. dUSD borrowers, specifically, can earn rebates based on their outstanding debt, funded by dUSD’s exogenous reserve earnings (e.g., from sFRAX). dUSD rebates are designed to reduce interest expenses and stimulate borrowing demand, boosting utilization as well as the average yield for lenders. Lenders and Curve LPs also earn liquidity rewards from dTRINITY in the form of dT points, plus FXTL points from Fraxtal, for supplying dUSD. The points will be converted to future utility/governance tokens upon their TGEs. dTRINITY’s early growth strategy is focused on attracting and subsidizing loopers of top yieldcoins, such as sUSDe from Ethena. Loopers can supply sUSDe as collateral to borrow dUSD at up to 80% LTV and earn ongoing interest rebates. With cheaper access to leverage, they can swap dUSD for more sUSDe on Curve to repeat the loop and amplify potential yield generation.

The process above relies on the FRAX/dUSD pool as the intermediary route to the FRAX/sUSDe pool (dUSD <> FRAX <> sUSDe). Through these pools, loopers will benefit from price stability, low slippage, and less gas fees on Fraxtal.

Ultimately, dTRINITY aims to position Fraxtal as the leading L2 for stablecoin loopers, lenders, and LPs. As dTRINITY grows over time, the Frax ecosystem will also benefit from:

Lower stablecoin borrowing costs and better looping yields

Sustainable lending and LP yields (including liquidity rewards)

More TVL on Fraxtal:

Borrowers importing collateral assets like sUSDe from other chains to loop

Lenders and LPs importing reserves from other chains to mint dUSD

More sFRAX TVL from dUSD’s reserve growth

More FRAX TVL from the Curve pool’s growth

More fee revenue for Frax from the Curve AMO

Other Important Information

Smart contract auditors: Halborn, Cyberscope, Verichains

Curve pool (FRAX/dUSD)

III. AMO Process

Frax authorizes and deploys its FRAX/dUSD Curve AMO

Frax mints dUSD by locking FRAX or sFRAX with dTRINITY

Frax allocates dUSD + FRAX to the Curve AMO

Frax receives Curve LP tokens to stake in Convex dTRINITY authorizes and deploys its Curve AMO (to be allocated as needed)

IV. Potential Risks & Mitigations

Liquidity & Depeg Risks: dUSD is not redeemable directly and can only be exchanged for available liquidity in the FRAX/dUSD Curve pool. This could lead to liquidity constraints when there is more dUSD selling pressure, causing it to depeg. If dUSD trades at a large discount <$1, Frax’s Curve AMO could experience unrealized losses. Potential risk mitigations, in turn, may include:

Arbitrage Opportunities:

Frax and/or other market participants (e.g., dUSD borrowers, LPs) can add FRAX to the pool or buy dUSD when it trades at a discount to restore price stability and capture arbitrage opportunities.

Stability Market Operations (SMO): dTRINITY can activate dUSD buybacks through its Curve SMO to stabilize the peg with full reserve backings.

Curve LP Incentives:

In addition to dT points and FXTL points, dTRINITY and Frax can explore partnerships (e.g., Curve) to incentivize LPs with CRV and other rewards for supplying liquidity.

Smart Contract Risks:

Vulnerabilities in dTRINITY’s smart contracts, including dUSD contracts, could lead to potential exploits and losses of Frax’s dUSD holdings. Risks include bugs in the code, governance manipulation, or attacks on integrations with external protocols (e.g., Curve). Potential risk mitigations, in turn, include:

Smart Contract Audits: dTRINITY has engaged and completed audits with leading firms like Halborn, Cyberscope, and Verichains to secure its contracts.

Bug Bounty Programs: dTRINITY will host bug bounties to reward white-hats with dUSD + dT points to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

Summary

This proposal seeks to establish a Frax Borrow AMO authorized to use treasury assets or mint FRAX and borrow stable assets (USDC, USDT, USDe) with a total borrow cap of $50 million to pursue yield-generating strategies. The primary focus of the AMO will be on stable AMM liquidity provision and yield-bearing stable assets, with the objective of creating a new revenue stream for Frax Finance. This AMO will only engage in yield opportunities deemed economically profitable and will utilize tier-one lending and collateralized debt protocols for security.

Background and Motivation

As Frax Finance continues to evolve, generating sustainable yield opportunities through carefully managed AMOs has become essential for protocol growth. The Frax Borrow AMO will leverage both newly minted FRAX and treasury assets to increase protocol income by participating in stable AMM liquidity provision and investing in yield-bearing stable assets. This strategy ensures that Frax Finance can optimize returns while maintaining a strong risk management framework.

Using treasury assets in conjunction with FRAX minting allows for greater flexibility and scale, enabling the AMO to participate in a diverse range of stable liquidity pools and assets. This approach is in line with Frax Finance's commitment to secure, sustainable revenue generation.

Proposal Details

Frax Borrow AMO Objectives

Mint FRAX and Utilize Treasury Assets: The AMO will have the flexibility to mint FRAX or use designated treasury assets to borrow stablecoins and enhance liquidity, with a $50 million cap on the total borrowed amount.

Focus on Stable AMM Liquidity Provision: The Frax Borrow AMO will prioritize stable AMM liquidity pools, supporting pools with stable asset pairs to earn yield while adding liquidity to key markets.

Yield-Bearing Stable Assets: The AMO will also focus on yield-bearing stable assets, investing in secure protocols that offer consistent returns on stable assets.

Economic Profitability Requirement: Transactions and strategies pursued by the Frax Borrow AMO will be ensuring the borrowing costs are outweighed by the potential returns.

Use of Tier-One Protocols Only: The AMO will engage only with tier-one lending and CDP protocols (

Compound ,

Aave ,

Llamalend , and

Yei on Sei Network) to maintain high security and reduce risk exposure.

Voting

For: Approve the establishment of the Frax Borrow AMO with a maximum $50 million borrow cap, authorization to mint FRAX, and the ability to use treasury assets for borrowing stables and engaging in yield-generating opportunities.

Ionic Protocol Core Team

Summary

This proposal seeks to onboard and activate an AMO that lends FRAX to the Ionic Protocol Fraxtal Market. We propose authorizing a lending AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the Supply Liquidity pool on Fraxtal, with a maximum authorized allocation of 2M FRAX to start. This will allow for users to leverage loop yield bearing assets using this supply liquidity and benefit from Ionic’s token flywheel to earn $ION emissions.

Depositors can acquire veION positions by locking their $ION to direct emissions and ultimately become key players in the emerging 'Ionic Wars'. ION emissions are determined to each chain from their globally proportional votes, so Fraxtal users collecting voting power allows Fraxtal to get more ION emissions and provides a great way to bootstrap the Fraxtal ecosystem with liquidity incentives. To further accelerate this, Ionic proposes to use Ionic’s veION voting power to direct additional ION emissions to this market, to help the Fraxtal Treasury earn $ION tokens and acquire voting power as well.

Background and Motivation

Ionic Protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial money market protocol focused exclusively on the OP Superchain ecosystem. Users can participate as depositors or borrowers, as well as voters. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn passive income (Supply APR + Emissions), while borrowers can borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) manner to loop assets and leverage yields in a fully optimized way.

Whilst Protocols can incentivize Voters to vote on their pools, both Suppliers and Depositors can earn $ION emissions on select markets. A novel veToken Model custom made for Lending allows participants to acquire large positions in the liquidity flywheel of the Protocol to direct increased emissions to their positions of choice over time using veION.

This integration will enhance the overall utility and stability of the FRAX and Fraxtal ecosystem and help to attract more DeFi power users to Frax Finance assets, further growing the Fraxtal user base and ecosystem. The $ION flywheel enables new DeFi strategies for FRAX, frxETH and sfrxETH to acquire additional Protocol Owned Liquidity using Treasury Assets in form of $ION and enables new multilayer vote escrow strategies when combined with Velodrome LP positions.

Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent Stablecoin derivatives, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the space.

Proposal Details

This proposal involves minting FRAX and depositing it into a designated Fraxtal lending market on Ionic Protocol. The goal is to provide sufficient liquidity for FRAX in order to overcome supply-side shortages in lending, thereby fostering growth on the borrowing side. By kickstarting the market for larger borrowers, we aim to create a more dynamic and robust lending environment for FRAX, frxETH, wfrxETH and sfrxETH on Ionic. Ionic will use its own veION voting power to direct emissions to Fraxtal to kickstart the velocity there.

Simultaneously this initiative supports the Ionic Protocol and the Superchain ecosystem at large by helping to kickstart the protocol's vote escrow system successfully.

Summary:

This proposal suggests that Frax Finance allocate 100 sfrxETH to provide liquidity for the sfrxETH/AsfrxETH pair on Curve. The integration will boost staking opportunities for sfrxETH, enabling users to earn competitive yields through Allstake while enhancing the utility of sfrxETH in DeFi ecosystems.

Background and Motivation:

Allstake’s meshed restaking mechanism allows liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to be staked across multiple chains, driving deeper liquidity and new use cases. By offering liquidity to the sfrxETH/AsfrxETH pool, Frax will unlock new staking pathways for sfrxETH holders and further integrate it into the broader multichain DeFi ecosystem.

Liquidity Requirement: Frax will allocate 100 sfrxETH.

50 sfrxETH will be deposited into Allstake to receive 50 AsfrxETH.

The 50 sfrxETH and 50 AsfrxETH will be used to create a liquidity pool on Curve (sfrxETH/AsfrxETH).

Risk Analysis:

There is minimal risk associated with this liquidity provision as Frax has full ownership of the LP position and can always choose to withdraw from the pool. There is also no impermanent loss.The primary risk lies in smart contract vulnerabilities. Allstake’s contracts are fully open-source and audited.

This proposal recommends that Frax Finance allocate 100,000 FXS to provide liquidity for the FXS/AFXS pair on Curve. The goal is to boost liquidity and utility for FXS within Allstake’s ecosystem, offering Frax new use cases for its governance token while driving additional staking opportunities for users.

Background and Motivation:

Allstake introduces new avenues for staking governance tokens across multiple chains. By providing liquidity to the FXS/AFXS pair, Frax will strengthen the market for FXS, driving further adoption and utility across different chains. Allstake's system allows for seamless integration of governance tokens into DeFi ecosystems, offering enhanced liquidity and staking incentives.

Proposal Details:

Liquidity Requirement: Frax will allocate 100,000 FXS.

50,000 FXS will be deposited into Allstake to receive 50,000 AFXS.

The 50,000 FXS and 50,000 AFXS will be used to create a liquidity pool on Curve (FXS/AFXS).

Risk Analysis:

There is minimal risk associated with this liquidity provision as Frax has the full ownership of the LP position and can always choose to withdraw from the pool. There is also no impermanent loss.The primary risk lies in smart contract vulnerabilities. Allstake’s contracts are fully open-source and audited. Frax’s allocation will be secured within these audited contracts.

Voting:

For: Allocate 100,000 FXS to provide initial liquidity for the FXS/AFXS pair on Curve.

Against: Do nothing.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0x9aac39e7280819b3fcd8940e3141b1129b0c5cb4e80d58bc06b713e1eb1489ec

Summary

This proposal seeks to update the existing allocation of FXS on Symbiotic by increasing the staking amount from the previously approved 1 million FXS to a maximum of 5 million FXS. Additionally, it proposes allocating up to $5 million worth of sfrxETH to Symbiotic, ensuring sufficient cap space to maximize the potential of the opportunity.

Background and Motivation

In FIP 407, Frax Finance approved the allocation of 1 million FXS to Symbiotic for staking. Now, with the strategic importance of Symbiotic’s restaking protocol and its ability to support decentralized services, Frax Finance intends to enhance this allocation to fully capture the yield potential and provide greater flexibility through additional assets like sfrxETH.

This proposal is aimed at increasing the overall allocation of assets on Symbiotic, ensuring that Frax Finance can maximize both yield generation and security provision by leveraging its FXS and sfrxETH holdings.

Proposal Details

This proposal seeks approval to:

Increase the FXS allocation for staking on Symbiotic from 1 million FXS to a maximum of 5 million FXS.

Allocate up to $5 million worth of sfrxETH for staking on Symbiotic.

Adjustments to the allocation of assets will be made based on market conditions, yield performance, and Symbiotic’s ecosystem growth.

Voting

For: Approve the increase of FXS allocation to a maximum of 5 million and allocate up to $5 million worth of sfrxETH for staking on Symbiotic.

Against: Do nothing and maintain the current 1 million FXS allocation.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0xf34df1c95441029b6c7a7c36ec086e8c986a724595b9e2ad30acdec1d5762f01

Summary

This proposal seeks to create a Karak Restaking AMO for the Frax Finance ecosystem. It proposes allocating up to $50 million worth of sfrxETH and sFRAX, and up to 5 million FXS from the protocol/community treasury, all to be restaked on the Fraxtal network.

Background and Motivation

Karak is a cutting-edge restaking protocol designed to enhance yield generation by allowing users to restake their assets, such as staked ETH, across multiple validators and protocols. This enables participants to maximize returns while securing various decentralized services. Karak’s protocol offers increased capital efficiency and maintains a focus on security and liquidity for staked assets.

Key features of Karak include:

Restaking for Higher Yields: Karak enables the compound yield of staked assets by restaking them across multiple validators and platforms.

Decentralization and Security: The protocol ensures security and decentralization, making it a reliable choice for stakers who want to maximize returns while minimizing risk.

Liquidity Flexibility: Karak allows restakers to maintain liquidity through liquid staking, making it easier for users to utilize their staked assets in other DeFi platforms.

By utilizing Karak’s restaking mechanism on the Fraxtal network, Frax Finance can diversify its yield strategies and improve returns on sfrxETH, sFRAX, and FXS, while also contributing to the liquidity and activity on the Fraxtal network. This integration aligns with Frax Finance’s long-term goal of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility of its assets through innovative partnerships and strategies.

Proposal Details

This proposal seeks to: sfrxETH: Authorize allocation of up to $50 million worth of sfrxETH to be restaked on the Karak protocol. sFRAX: Authorize allocation of up to $50 million worth of sFRAX to be restaked on the Karak protocol.

FXS: Authorize the allocation of up to 5 million FXS from the Frax protocol/community treasury to be restaked on the Karak protocol. This allocation will not involve minting new FXS and will be fully drawn from the existing treasury, adhering to the FXS cap of 100 million. This proposal does not, in any way, alter the 100 million FXS cap, and all FXS allocated comes from within the established limits.

The allocation will be dynamically adjusted by the Frax Finance core team based on market conditions and yield performance, with regular reviews to ensure optimal returns for the Frax ecosystem and its treasury.

Summary

This proposal seeks to migrate the Snapshot voting process from the Ethereum mainnet to the Fraxtal network. By transitioning to Fraxtal, we aim to enhance the voting experience for the Frax community by leveraging Fraxtal’s advanced scalability and flexibility features.

Background and Motivation

Currently, Frax Finance conducts its Snapshot voting on the Ethereum mainnet. However, by leveraging Fraxtal’s infrastructure, we aim to optimize our governance experience and integrate more effectively with our ecosystem.

Migrating Snapshot voting to Fraxtal will not only streamline our operations but also position Fraxtal as a central hub for governance activities. This move will allow us to accumulate voting power from both our veFXS holders on the mainnet and those on Fraxtal, creating a more unified and influential voting base. Additionally, by setting this precedent, we hope to encourage other projects to consider Fraxtal for their governance needs, further solidifying its role in the broader DeFi ecosystem.

Voting

For:

Approve the migration of Snapshot voting from Ethereum mainnet to Fraxtal.

Against:

Continue using Ethereum mainnet for Snapshot voting.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0x60ce169bce5174b399fa09ccc35c14e692a6bb19229d5957e44940f58e89efbc

Overview:

We should use the treasury held FXS to generate additional protocol revenue. I believe we should do so by restaking it with our existing partner Symbiotic.

Details:

I propose depositing 1,000,000 FXS from the Treasury into the Symbiotic FXS pool. This will generate additional yield at an undeterminable rate.

Closing Thoughts

FRAX is sprinting towards 100% CR and needs to earn additional income however it can. This allows us to do some while participating in a positive-sum game with our partner Symbiotic.

Overview:

We should use the Comptroller-held WBTC to generate additional protocol revenue. I believe we should do so by converting a portion into tBTC and staking it in the WBTC/tBTC curve pool.

Details:

The Frax treasury currently holds 37.9 WBTC equivalent to $2,131,571 at the time of this post. I propose staking the entire amount in the tBTC/WBTC Curve pool which is currently generating 7.16% in the Convex Curve WBTC+tBTC pool. The corresponding curve pool can be seen here: https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crvusd-16/

Assuming current valuations and yields, Frax would earn an additional $152,620 a year by doing this.

Closing Thoughts

FRAX is sprinting towards 100% CR and needs to earn additional income however it can. This allows us to convert a non-income generating asset into an income-generating asset.

Overview

Frax is holding a significant amount of PyUSD on it’s balance sheet that is earning a very insignificant amount of interest. Frax should diversify away from holdings that have low-interest generation.

Position Overview:

As of this post, the existing positions are:

PyUSD held in Curve FRAX/PYUSD: $1,760,722 earning 0.04%

PyUSD Staked in Convex: $617,874 earning 1%

Combinedm Frax owns $2,378,596 of PyUSD. Additionally, Frax has allocated $11,103,288 of FRAX towards those pools, bringing the total amount allocated to $13,481,884.

Closing Thoughts

FRAX is sprinting towards 100% CR and needs to hyper-optimize how it allocates it’s funds and make sure that no money is being inefficiently supplied. Therefore, I recommend that we exclusively allocate capital where it can generate the highest yield which in this case is the Fraxlend AMO.

Summary:

Propose the creation of a new Fraxlend pair on the Ethereum Mainnet: sfrxETH/sFRAX

Details:

Fraxlend Pair Name 1: sfrxETH/sFRAX

Chain:

Ethereum Mainnet

Max Loan-to-Value (LTV) : 75%

Background and Motivation: sFRAX is the yield-generating primitive of the Frax stablecoin and can be thought of as Frax’s cost of capital. Therefore, when lending sFRAX via AMO Frax Finance can be assured of profitability regardless of how much money it deposits in the pool.

Positives:

Guaranteed AMO Profitability:

As long as there are no liquidations that take on bad debt, Frax AMO’s will need less managing because FRAX lent into the pool will always be earning more than Frax’s cost of capital

More liquidity:

For lenders, the sFRAX pools can be thought of as restaking lending pools that allow them to return additional yield on-top of the existing yield they’re already generating from sFRAX. As a result, I’d expect a decent portion of the $47m to be deposited as liquidity.

Cheaper Borrowing:

Lower borrowing rates because the borrower doesn’t need to subsidize the entire unlent portion of the pool. All unlent sFRAX is still appreciating in value.

Negatives:

Reduced Fraxlend Revenue:

Fraxlend won’t profit off of the intrinsic borrowing cost associated with sFrax, so if the lending rate is functionally 8% Fraxlend will only earn fees on 8 – sFRAX Rate = 2%.

Higher Gas Fees:

Borrowers will need to unwrap sFRAX for FRAX anytime they want to borrow money.

Less Clear Borrowing Cost:

The real borrowing cost is abstracted from the user but this can be resolved in the future with a minor UI change.

No Frax AMO Support:

Frax AMOs don’t directly support sFRAX but they are largely manually managed, so I don’t think the conversion should be problematic. If this is untrue, please let me know in the comments.

Frax AMO impact on sFRAX yield:

The sFRAX contract does not have functionality to ignore a portion of minted sFRAX when distributing profits, so all AMO Minted sFRAX would receive a portion of profits reducing the underlying sFRAX yield. This could be offset on a 1-week behind basis by adding all profits held by unlent sFRAX back to the sFRAX contract.

Additional Details:

The Fraxlend Fees for sFRAX pools can be raised to account for the lower revenue if we want.

Liquidity Profile: sFRAX is always losslessly convertible to FRAX, so it shares it’s liquidity profile. The Max LTV is identical to that of the sfrxEth pool, so that shouldn’t be a concern.

Curve Details:

To account for the underlying sFRAX yield, we’ll need to create a new significantly less step Curve. I would suggest a curve where the Borrow limit linearly increases from 0.5% to 4% until hitting 85% utilization, at which point if would mimic the behavior of the Variable 2 curve.

Closing Thoughts:

I believe that in the future a significant portion of debt will be denominated in term of the yield-generating primitive much like real-world loans are denominated in terms of SOFR, so we should try to get ahead of the curve.

Moso Shops is a platform that integrates token-based rewards into retail transactions, offering a unique way to enhance user engagement and power transactions across one’s ecosystem. The platform is designed to cater to both web2 and web3 users.

It enables users to shop at over 2000+ supported web2 retailers including Walmart, Marriott, and eBay to earn in the crypto asset of their choice. Additionally, Moso offers a custom, white-labeled shopping experience for web3 brands where users can earn up to 100% cash back or more exclusively in the ecosystem’s native token. For

Galxe Shop , the rewards are partially funded by both the merchant and Galxe.

Moso has seen $500,000+ in purchases, registered

100,000+ sign-ups, and distributed $200,000+ in crypto rewards back to users.

Moso aims to work directly with Frax to provide $FXS cash-back rewards in a Frax Shop, powered By Moso.

We’re thrilled about the opportunity to integrate deeply into the Frax ecosystem as the only retail shop to earn cash back experience fully distributed in $FXS.

How are the cash-back rewards distributed?

Moso requests a token allocation from Frax to boost cash back rates, on top of the fixed cash back rates paid to Moso by the Web2 merchants for driving purchases to these retailers.

Increased rates will only sometimes be available. Boosted cash back rates of as much as 100% back in $FXS at selected merchants will be deployed from time to time allowing users to find amazing shopping deals that they otherwise would not have access to. In this scenario, the rewards are partially funded by both the merchant and Frax.

When boosted rates are not being deployed, web2 merchants distribute cash back to Moso. Moso converts the fiat cash-back to tokens on the backend for distribution to eligible users. In this scenario, the merchant fully funds the rewards.

Amazingly, users will always be earning cash back in $FXS.

How can a white-labeled shop benefit Frax?

Powering Transactions:

Increase user engagement and value.

A great way to get new users onboarded to Frax and Fraxtal.

Fiat Integration:

Seamless integration of fiat currency into tokens, enhancing token utility and value. Fiat retail purchases = $FXS rewards.

Delayed Rewards:

Token lock-up during the payout period to maintain user interest.

Retail Audience Focus:

Target a retail-heavy web2 and web3 audience, catching the attention of users interested in deals and rewards.

Demonstrate that Frax is more than just a DeFi and L2 ecosystem.

Web2 User Exposure:

Attract new holders and users from the traditional Web2 retail space.

Discoverability of Frax and Fraxtal.

Additional Token Utility:

Provide various incentives, allowing users to qualify for up to 100% cash back on purchases.

Custom actions enable users to earn cash back and other rewards.

Great option for ecosystem users who already shop online. Why not have them earn and hold your native token?

Increase demand and liquidity.

Crypto Back Offers:

Transactions on the protocol level can qualify users for $FXS cash back, driving further engagement.

Frax will become the prime destination for crypto-based online shopping rewards.

Moso’s game plan and execution

Our goal is to onboard new users to the Frax ecosystem, drive visibility to Frax as the leading DeFi and L2 ecosystem, and re-engage existing users all through Moso. Throughout all of this, Frax can identify valuable, active ecosystem users with a real-world use case. This data can be leveraged in any marketing campaign Frax executes moving forward to continue to capture market share among users.

Moso plans to distribute loyalty points to users in parallel with the higher cash-back rates in $FXS. Loyalty points can be earned by users continuing to visit the Frax Shop to Earn page daily. To include additional gamification methods, points will also be distributed from purchases at retailers and for engaging with different Frax ecosystem dapps/DeFi integrations.

Moso also acts as a gateway for users to discover Frax’s best applications and DeFi integrations. Moso will work with the Frax team to understand which applications to highlight on the Frax Shop alongside retailers.

By engaging with dapps and executing an on-chain action, the user will qualify for points and cash back. Cash-back rewards by engaging with Fraxtal dapps are TBD as that discussion will take place with the application since it revolves around the kickback the dapp can give in return for the conversion. This is the perfrect fit for dapps who already have a referral program in place or are in need of a referral program.

Each shopping trip will power up to three on-chain transactions on Fraxtal for users engaging with the Frax Shop. Fraxtal would be the first L2 ecosystem to be fully integrated into Moso.

The user claims $FXS on Fraxtal through Moso to claim their cash back

Usual, 0xloth (Morpho), MEV Capital Team

Summary

This proposal seeks to establish an Algorithmic Market Operation (AMO) utilizing Morpho for lending and liquidity management. Specifically, it aims to first integrate USD0++ (

0x35D8949372D46B7a3D5A56006AE77B215fc69bC0 ) and Curve LP USD0/USD0++ (

0x1d08e7adc263cfc70b1babe6dc5bb339c16eec52 ) markets as collateral on Morpho to support Frax as borrowing assets, enhancing the utility and stability of both assets in the DeFi ecosystem.

Background and Motivation

Morpho is a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol that optimizes yield for lenders and reduces borrowing costs for borrowers by having new rate computation functions. This integration aligns with our commitment to decentralization, transparency, and financial empowerment.

MEV Capital is a DeFi asset manager that already has more than $300M in assets under management and is already curator on Symbiotic and Mellow. Their knowledge in DeFi is now clearly established, making them a natural choice to curate Usual’s Morpho vaults. As such, MEV Capital will be at the disposal of Frax to co-curate the Frax AMO.

Usual is a new decentralized stablecoins issuer that accepts RWAs as collateral (

USYC by

Hashnote ). USD0++ is a liquid bond token that represents locked USD0, accruing pills (the points of Usual) over time. The USD0/USD0++ Curve LP market provides deep liquidity and low slippage for stablecoin swaps while also accruing pills and fees. By leveraging these assets as collateral within Morpho, we can create a more dynamic and robust lending environment, attracting larger borrowers and creating growth across our ecosystem.

Proposal Details

This proposal involves minting FRAX and depositing it into a designated Morpho lending market (i.e USD0++/FRAX and CurveLP(USD0/USD0++)/FRAX). The goal is to provide sufficient liquidity for FRAX in order to overcome supply-side shortages in lending, thereby fostering growth on the borrowing side. By kickstarting the market for larger borrowers, we aim to create a more dynamic and robust lending environment for FRAX on Morpho and deeper connection in the short term with Usual. Oracle choice will be decided with the Frax team.

Usual will incentivize the FRAX side with the same conditions as all other lending markets. (USD0++/USDC and CurveLP (USD0/USD0++)/USDC) Those pills will be given to the Frax Treasury. (1 pills per dollar + 5 bonus pills for each newly USD0++minted).

The markets have not been created yet and will be established in collaboration with the Frax team. The default parameter applied is a maximum of 86% LTV. After the integration, Usual will also create a FRAX/USD0 pool on Curve to simplify the loops.

Voting • For: Approve the Frax AMO integration with a max authorized allocation of 50,000,000 FRAX on MetaMorpho Vault. Also, initiating the vault as a borrowing source for the to be created USD0++/FRAX and CurveLP(USD0/USD0++)/FRAX Morpho-markets when those would be created. • Against: Do not proceed with the proposal.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0xcdf89f15b222a0a8cd87d8f9706e2d378d61f0ba15039baaa8de29e97638ee12

Frax Core Team

Summary

This proposal seeks to authorize a revised maximum annual budget of

4,100,000 FRAX for Frax Finance for the fiscal year 2024-2025. The revised budget reflects significant cuts across various categories to ensure financial prudence while continuing to support essential operations and initiatives. The budget is intended to cover four key categories: Development & Operation, Security, Legal & Compliance, and Fraxtal Growth under the Fraxtal Builders Program. Please note that this is a maximum cap, and it is highly likely that not all of it will be used, as we only spent 5,123,990 FRAX last year out of the 9,000,000 FRAX budget that we had during the last fiscal year.

Background and motivation

As Frax Finance continues to grow and evolve, this budget supports our core operations while enabling strategic growth within the Fraxtal ecosystem. The allocation focuses on maintaining our development and operational capacity, ensuring security, managing legal and compliance obligations, and selectively supporting key initiatives within the Fraxtal ecosystem.

Details

Budget Categories

Development and Operation:

This budget will be used to cover the costs associated with the development and operation of the Frax Finance protocol. This could include salaries for developers, costs of new feature development, maintenance costs, infrastructure costs, and other operational expenses.

Security (Audits and Bug Bounty):

This budget is allocated to maintaining the security of the Frax Finance protocol. This includes the costs of regular security audits by external firms, running a bug bounty program to incentivize the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities and other measures to ensure the safety and trust of our community.

Legal and Compliance:

This budget covers legal and compliance costs to ensure that Frax Finance operates within the legal framework. This could include fees for legal counsel, regulatory compliance costs, potential legal disputes, and other related expenses. Notably, Frax Finance has not encountered any significant legal issues to date, and last year, we spent less than 5% of the allotted legal budget. This allocation remains in place to ensure we are prepared for any unforeseen legal requirements.

Fraxtal Ecosystem Grants (Fraxtal Builders Program):

This new budget category aims to support the growth of the Fraxtal ecosystem through the Fraxtal Builders Program. Although limited, this budget supports critical initiatives within the Fraxtal ecosystem, focusing on strategic growth and development. And it can be boosted by allocating Frax Finance grants from Superchain grant programs.

Additional Notes

This proposal represents the maximum caps for each category, not necessarily the exact amounts that will be used.

This proposal does not cover the costs of liquidity incentivization. Kindly refer to the

Votium and

WETHR proposals for budget allocations related to liquidity incentivization.

All previously approved budgets are still in effect and considered in our ongoing operations. This proposal is designed to supplement and build upon the existing financial strategies.

This proposal does not account for FXS. The team plans to continue utilizing their current treasury allotment of FXS for core development compensation. If more/less FXS resources become necessary in the future, a specific governance proposal will be initiated.

Summary

This proposal seeks to provide liquidity providers within the Frax Finance ecosystem the option to exchange their locked liquidity in certain pools for timed locked Frax Bond 2027 (

LFXB2027 ) at the auction price.

Background and Motivation

Following the success of

FIP 379 , which allowed LPs to exit their positions through a standard exit mechanism, there has been continued interest in providing additional options for liquidity providers who wish to exit their locked positions. To address this, we propose adding LFXB2027 as a new exit option, offering liquidity providers more flexibility while maintaining the integrity and stability of the Frax ecosystem.

Proposal Details

This approach offers liquidity providers a way to exit their positions while maintaining their investment within the Frax ecosystem, ensuring the protocol's stability and growth. The following points are important to note about this proposal:

Pricing Based on Underlying Assets:

The pricing for the locked liquidity will be based on the current price of the underlying assets at the time of the exchange.

Exchange with LFXB2027:

Locked liquidity can be exchanged for LFXB2027 at the auction price prevailing at the time of the exchange. An LP that wishes to migrate can sign the migration transaction on the Ethereum mainnet and move their LP token/NFT to the protocol to receive LFXB2027 tokens directly to the same address on the Fraxtal mainnet.

Extra Option Alongside FXB2029:

It is important to emphasize that LFXB2027 is being introduced as an additional option. Liquidity providers still have the choice to exit their locked positions through FXB2029, ensuring that they can select the exit strategy that best suits their needs.

Designated Locked Liquidity for Exchange:

Only certain designated pools will be eligible for this exchange option, but this list can be expanded through the governance process.

Uniswap V3 FRAX/DAI

0xF22471AC2156B489CC4a59092c56713F813ff53e

Option to Retain LPs:

Liquidity providers will have the option to either exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 or LFXB2027 or retain their current locked positions.

No Ragequit Fee: There will be no Ragequit fee for liquidity providers choosing this exchange method, ensuring a cost-effective transition.

FXTL points:

Migrators that receive LFXB2027 for their positions will be entitled to all FXTL points multipliers for all LFXB2027 holders, making it a high-yield opportunity within the Frax ecosystem.

TimedLocker for FXBs:

The TimedLocker allows liquidity providers to stake their FXB tokens in exchange for fixed-rate FXS rewards, with the total amount of FXB stakable being capped. Locked positions are transferable as vault tokens, enabling users to sell or transfer their stakes without waiting for the lock period to end. Once the set ending timestamp is reached, all positions become unlockable.

Voting

For: Approve the option for liquidity providers to exchange their locked liquidity for LFXB2027 at the auction price.

Background and Motivation

The proposal seeks to introduce new markets into Fraxlend on Ethereum, offering opportunities for borrowing assets like USDT, DAI, GHO, crvUSD, DOLA, and USDC with sfrxETH as collateral. As the Frax Finance protocol continues to evolve and expand, incorporating new markets will enhance its versatility and attract a wider user base.

Partnerships and Ecosystem Growth

Where necessary, we propose bootstrapping the pools with treasury-owned liquidity. By utilizing treasury assets to provide initial liquidity, we can ensure immediate and robust liquidity for the new markets, maintain better control and stability within the pools, and align incentives more closely with the long-term health and stability of the Frax ecosystem.

In addition to using treasury-owned liquidity, we are actively seeking to fill any gaps by expanding partnerships with the protocols that issue the assets. By collaborating directly with these protocols, we aim to foster a positive sum environment that benefits all parties involved. This approach includes having asset providers natively issue their stablecoins on Fraxlend, enhancing market depth and liquidity, and ensuring a steady supply of stablecoins to meet market demand.

By focusing on stablecoins with similar ethos, sufficient demand, and liquidity, we ensure that we align with projects that share our values and vision, while also providing reliable and liquid markets for our users.

Summary

Propose the creation of a new Fraxlend pair on the Ethereum mainnet: ezETH/FRAX.

Details

Fraxlend Pair Name: ezETH/FRAX - Variable Rate V2

Chain:

Ethereum Mainnet

Max Authorized Allocation:

10,000,000 FRAX

Max Loan-to-Value (LTV):

To be decided by the development team.

Background and Motivation

Fraxlend is a lending platform that enables the creation of markets between pairs of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair functions as an isolated, permission-less market, allowing users to engage in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is designed to generate new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) enhance FRAX’s capabilities as a leading stablecoin protocol by offering maximum flexibility and opportunities without compromising its core stability mechanisms. To date, multiple AMOs have been deployed on platforms such as Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari.

Introducing the ezETH/FRAX pair into the Fraxlend AMO on Ethereum Mainnet aligns with this strategic vision. It will facilitate the minting of FRAX, secured by over-collateralized debt, further strengthening the ecosystem. The choice of ezETH as an asset is based on its growing popularity and liquidity, which can attract a broader user base to Fraxlend. Allowing the development team to decide the LTV ensures that the risk parameters are set appropriately based on market conditions and risk assessments.

Liquidity Profile

The liquidity profile of the ezETH token is a crucial factor in the decision to introduce the ezETH/FRAX pair. The following image shows the slippage curve for ezETH, illustrating how liquidity impacts trading:

This curve indicates that ezETH has a significant liquidity pool, which helps maintain stability and reduce slippage during large trades. A robust liquidity profile is essential for minimizing risks and ensuring the smooth functioning of the Fraxlend pair.

Why Adding ezETH to Fraxlend is Beneficial

Adding ezETH to Fraxlend brings significant benefits to the platform and its users. As the second highest restaking token by market cap according to CoinGecko, ezETH offers a robust liquidity profile and strong market interest. This high liquidity ensures stability and minimizes slippage during large trades, making ezETH an attractive asset for lending and borrowing activities.

Moreover, the growing adoption of ezETH in the DeFi space underscores its reliability and potential for high yield opportunities. By integrating ezETH into Fraxlend, the platform can attract a broader user base, enhance its market offerings, and support the overall growth and diversification of the Frax ecosystem.

Summary

Deploy Fraxferry for sFRAX, FRAX, FXS between Fraxtal and TRON, with the following details :

Background and Motivation

The TRON public chain, a decentralized blockchain network based on the Tron protocol, has served as the core of the Tron ecosystem since its launch on June 25th, 2018. TRON has become a significant player in the stablecoin market, with a total value locked (TVL) reaching an all-time high of $58 billion (

DefiLlama ), primarily driven by USDT. The absence of both stablecoin alternatives and USD yield-bearing assets on TRON presents a great opportunity for FRAX and sFRAX to shine in this market. FRAX can offer a stable, decentralized alternative to USDT, while sFRAX can meet the demand for yield-bearing assets, providing users with more options for earning returns on their holdings.

Fraxferry aims to simplify the cross-chain bridging issue for assets, making it easier to deploy Frax-related tokens on other chains. Frax Ferry is a slower, simpler, but more secure method of bridging tokens. And you can read more about it here .

Summary

Request authorization for the protocol to issue FXB20271231 with a 30 million cap for the bond. Additionally, authorize Fraxlend AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the specified Fraxlend pair with the mentioned max authorized allocation.

Chain

Fraxlend Pair Address

Max Authorized Allocation

FXB20271231/FRAX - Variable Rate V2

Ethereum, Fraxtal

TBD

25,000,000 FRAX

Background and Motivation

FXB tokens are simple, trustless tokens that resemble a zero-coupon bond that converts to the FRAX stablecoin on maturity. FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXBs allow the formation of a yield curve to price the time value of lending FRAX back to the protocol itself.

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding new FXBs is beneficial as it expands the FRAX ecosystem's offerings, enhances liquidity, and provides users with additional tools for managing risk and optimizing investment strategies. Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Summary

This proposal seeks to add two new asset types, ezETH and pzETH, to the assets that the frxETH Automated Market Operations (AMO) can hold and to allocate a portion of the frxETH AMO funds within the Fraxtal network. The goal is to enhance diversification, optimize returns, and support the growth of the Fraxtal network.

The proposed allocation caps for frxETH Curve AMO are:

Current Asset Allocation:

ETH, WETH: Max 100% Min 50% wstETH, stETH: Max 50% Min 0%

Proposed Asset Allocation:

ETH, WETH: Max 100% Min 0% wstETH, stETH: Max 100% Min 0% ezETH, pzETH: Max 20% Min 0%

This means the team can allocate up to the specified maximum percentages to the respective pools if deemed advantageous.

It is important to clarify that the min/max caps specified in this proposal are separate from the ""withholding ratio."" The caps are not intended to suggest that we are directing 100% of all ETH minted from frxETH to the AMO. The withholding ratio of ETH is a separate parameter. These max/min caps are put in place to govern the portion of the withheld ETH that will be allocated to the pools within the AMO. more information about the current frxETH balance sheet can be found in

Frax Facts .

Background and Motivation

Automated Market Operations (AMO) make Frax Finance one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism. In Frax Ethereum, most of our Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) resides on Curve, so setting clear allocation caps is crucial for managing our liquidity effectively and transparently in frxETH Curve AMO.

Adding ezETH and pzETH to the portfolio offers significant value by providing another assets that aligns with our goals of optimizing returns and enhancing liquidity. Additionally, allocating a portion of the frxETH AMO within the Fraxtal ecosystem will support its growth and provide necessary liquidity, fostering innovation and activity on Fraxtal.

About ezETH ezETH is a liquid restaking token representing a user’s restaked position at

Renzo . Users can deposit native ETH or LSTs and receive ezETH. It is a reward-bearing token similar to cTokens, and the underlying restaking positions earn rewards reflected in the ezETH price. Rewards are expected in ETH, USDC, and Actively Validated Services (AVSs) reward tokens. This means the value of ezETH increases relative to the underlying LSTs as it earns more rewards in AVS tokens. Withdrawals take at least 7 days due to EigenLayer unstaking requirements, and transfers are facilitated through supplying liquidity or selling ezETH on

Balancer .

About pzETH pzETH is a liquid restaking token representing a user’s restaked position within the Symbiotic ecosystem. Users can deposit stETH, wstETH, wETH, or ETH to receive pzETH. It offers a higher yield than traditional ETH staking by securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs) through restaking. pzETH can be withdrawn from day one and is fully redeemable for the underlying restaked collateral.

Proposal Details

Authorize Holding ezETH: Allow the frxETH AMO to hold ezETH as one of its asset types.

Set Allocation Caps: Establish the following maximum and minimum allocation caps for the frxETH AMO:

ETH/WETH Pools: Max 100%, Min 0% wstETH/stETH Pools: Max 100%, Min 0% ezETH/pzETH Pools: Max 20%, Min 0%

Deploy Assets on Fraxtal: Allocate a portion of the frxETH AMO to be deployed within the Fraxtal ecosystem. The specified allocation caps for ETH, WETH, wstETH, stETH, ezETH, and pzETH pools also apply to assets deployed in Fraxtal. For assets on Fraxtal, the Fraxtal native bridge will be used for WETH, stETH, and wstETH, while the Hyperlane bridge will be used for ezETH and pzETH.

Voting

For: Authorize frxETH AMO to add ezETH and pzETH as assets and allocate funds in curve pools based on the mentioned max and min authorized asset allocations.

Summary

This proposal seeks to provide liquidity providers within the Frax Finance ecosystem the option to exchange their locked liquidity in certain pools for Frax Bond 2029 (FXB2029) at the auction price.

Background and Motivation

Many liquidity providers within the Frax Finance ecosystem have recently expressed a need for a ragequit or exit mechanism for their locked liquidity in FXS gauges. To address this concern and provide a flexible solution, we propose an exchange option to migrate the locked liquidity to FXBs, specifically FXB2029. This provides immediate liquidity to exit LPs starting with the older gauges while also keeping TVL within the Frax & Fraxtal ecosystem, an overall value add for all parties. FXB2029 tokens are liquid with high incentives for liquidity providers, massive FXTL points boosts, and migrators can exit these tokens should they want to leave the ecosystem for any reason by selling them on-chain in Curve pools and other venues and in no way required to hold them until maturity.

FXB tokens are simple, trustless tokens that resemble a zero-coupon bond that converts to the FRAX stablecoin on maturity. FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXB tokens are only convertible to FRAX stablecoins; they do not guarantee FRAX peg, FRAX value, or yield/interest denominated in any other asset except FRAX.

By migrating to FXBs, liquidity providers will have an alternative means to manage their deployed capital within the Frax ecosystem, providing them with the flexibility they have requested while ensuring the protocol maintains its needed locked liquidity.

Proposal Details

This approach offers liquidity providers a way to exit their positions while maintaining their investment within the Frax ecosystem, ensuring the protocol's stability and growth. The following points are important to note about this proposal:

Pricing Based on Underlying Assets:

The pricing for the locked liquidity will be based on the current price of the underlying assets at the time of the exchange.

Exchange with FXB2029:

Locked liquidity can only be exchanged for FXB2029 at the auction price prevailing at the time of the exchange. The auction price has a floor price of .794 at the time of this proposal & it is expected to remain at this floor price. An LP that wishes to migrate can sign the migration transaction on the Ethereum mainnet and move their LP token/NFT to the protocol to receive FXB2029 tokens directly to the same address on the Fraxtal mainnet. They are then free to do whatever they wish with their FXB2029 tokens.

Designated Locked Liquidity for Exchange:

Only certain designated pools will be eligible for this exchange option, but this list can be expanded through the governance process.

Option to Retain LPs:

Liquidity providers will have the option to either exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 or retain their current locked positions.

No Ragequit Fee:

There will be no Ragequit fee for liquidity providers choosing this exchange method, ensuring a cost-effective transition.

FXTL points & incentives:

Migrators that receive FXB2029 for their positions will be entitled to all FXTL points multipliers & yield opportunities that are available and upcoming for all FXB2029 holders, making it one of the most high-yield opportunities within the Frax ecosystem.

Summary

This proposal seeks to onboard and activate an AMO that lends FRAX to Aave v3. We propose authorizing a lending AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the aFRAX v3 pool with a maximum authorized allocation of 100,000,000 FRAX.

Background and Motivation

Aave is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn passive income, while borrowers can borrow overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) manner.

Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space.

This integration will enhance the overall utility and stability of the FRAX ecosystem and help to attract more users to Frax Finance assets, further growing our user base and ecosystem.

Proposal Details

This proposal involves minting FRAX and depositing it into a designated Aave v3 lending market. The goal is to provide sufficient liquidity for FRAX in order to overcome supply-side shortages in lending, thereby fostering growth on the borrowing side. By kickstarting the market for larger borrowers, we aim to create a more dynamic and robust lending environment for FRAX on Aave.

Voting

Summary

There has been long discussions on how veFXS rewards should be distributed. There is merit to both buying back and distributing FXS and distributing a stable coin such as sFrax or sfrxEth. In the end users can swap for the token they want (albeit liquidity can differ between the tokens).

The token of choice should be one that ""does work"" for the protocol and user. The more work done, the better the token choice. For example on Curve the fee token was originally 3Crv LP token. This was because having deeper liquidity on 3Crv was a major source of protocol fees.  Curve has now switched to crvUSD as each crvUSD in distribution is equivalent to a crvUSD being lent out and creating fees.

One possible choice for Frax could be sFrax. sFrax does a lot of work for the user, but not all that much is gained on the protocol level. This can be an okay tradeoff though if claiming continued to be on mainnet since gas costs are higher and thus times to claim could be much longer for most users.

On Fraxtal however, gas costs are much less of an issue. Thus reward tokens should be more oriented for Protocol work. This is both good for the user in an indirect way, as well as users can withdraw and convert to something more oriented for their yield whenever they want.

The best asset choice for the protocol to issue would thus be an FXB. The protocol makes revenue in the background while the frax is waiting to be matured. If users claim and convert the FXB on the market, the protocol still has the underlying working. FXBs themselves also are yield bearing for the user (albeit at probably a slower rate than sFrax).

This proposal seeks to change veFXS revenue to be distributed as a wrapped version of the FXB20291231 issued on Fraxtal. The FXS buyback as part of the FLE system will stay the same.

The wrapper for this token will automatically use the underlying FXB as collateral in FraxLend and borrow frax for sFrax if interest rates are profitable. Users will gain compounded FXB tokens and can withdraw at any time.  FraxLend AMO will also gain some interest by lending to the FraxLend pair.

Wrapper can be found here ( https://github.com/convex-eth/frax-cvx-platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/fraxtal/cvxFXB.sol ) and is currently under audit. Audit must be cleared to satisfactory levels before being used as the veFXS reward token.

As of note, the wrapper will contain a migration function to move underlying fxb to a different fxb type. The admin role for setting this migration will be held by the Frax comptroller multisig or Frax Governance.

Also the current name of the token (cvxFXB) is subject to change if we or the Frax team decide on something better before deployment.

Fees

There will be a standard market fee of 10% as a management fee.

This fee is only applied to revenue gained via the borrowing aspect of the wrapper and in no way applies to underlying vefxs rewards.

Voting

For: Change veFXS reward token distribution to the cvxFXB FXB wrapper.

Arbitrum is a leading Layer 2 technology that empowers you to explore and build in the largest Layer 1 ecosystem: Ethereum.

Arbitrum Foundation approached us to ensure a secure and successful ARB token launch in March 2023. Our team immediately began detecting a surge of impersonation attempts and implemented a multi-layered security strategy to protect the Arbitrum community and brand in the wider ecosystem.

ARB Token Launch

During the first twelve days of the ARB token launch, ChainPatrol effectively blocked 1200+ online threats across leading crypto wallets. The fast response protection at wallets was critical to preventing widespread losses from impersonation, and speeding up takedowns from several days to just a few minutes.

Arbitrum shines as an industry leader, recognizing the overwhelming pain point of malicious domains and the direct impact threats have on the growth of its online community. ""Keeping the Arbitrum community safe is an interative and ongoing process that ChainPatrol has helped to simplify, as well as improve, with the removal of over 4000 threats and scams""  - @Eli_Defi, Community Lead, Arbitrum Foundation 👣 Next Steps:

Background and Motivation:

Fraxlend is a lending platform that enables the creation of markets between pairs of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair functions as an isolated, permission-less market, allowing users to engage in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is designed to generate new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) enhance FRAX's capabilities as a leading stablecoin protocol by offering maximum flexibility and opportunities without compromising its core stability mechanisms. To date, multiple AMOs have been deployed on platforms such as Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari.

Introducing the WETH/FRAX pair into the Fraxlend AMO on Ethereum Mainnet aligns with this strategic vision. It will facilitate the minting of FRAX, secured by over-collateralized debt, further strengthening the ecosystem. Additionally, increasing the LTV to 82% makes this pair more competitive with similar offerings on Maker and Aave, thereby attracting more users and liquidity to Fraxlend.

Symbiosis

Symbiosis is looking to deploy FRAX Octopool among 6 supported chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum One, Avalanche, Polygon POS, Fraxtal.

Besides that, Symbiosis will integrate Fraxtal as a new chain on Symbiosis and deploy wETH pool there where Symbiosis will provide their own liquidity.

On top of that, Symbiosis will connect 1inch, OpenOcean, Izumi and other DEXs to provide routing to get any assets on those chains including frxETH, sfrxETH, FPI, sFRAX and others.

Symbiosis partners such as Li. fi (Jumper), Socket (Bungee), Rubic, Rango, OKX DEX and more will be able to integrate these pools for FRAX cross-chain transfers between different chains.

Benefits for FRAX and Fraxtal:

Symbiosis will provide solution to easily move FRAX between all popular chains similar how Circle CCTP works

Symbiosis will integrate Fraxtal a new chain and connect it to 30 chains that we support

Symbiosis will create wETH on Fraxtal and add their own liquidity there

Symbiosis will be core provider in Li. fi (Jumper) OP-stack chains cross-chain campaign

Symbiosis will connect FRAX Octopool with all popular on-chain aggregators and DEXs on chains supported by FRAX Octopool

As members of the Frax team have mentioned, Fraxtal’s vision is to become the ‘M2 chain’ (e.g. yield bearing assets such as sFRAX are native and foundational), whereas Ethereum mainnet is akin to an ‘M1 chain’ (e.g. ETH isn’t inherently yield bearing). Balancer has solidified its position as a primary liquidity hub for yield bearing assets across the EVM ecosystem evident with over $500m in LST and LRT TVL . Its unique, yet battle-tested, AMM design makes Balancer well positioned to support Fraxtal as an integral part of Fraxtal’s liquidity layer for both yield bearing assets and core strategic liquidity.

While Balancer and Frax have a longstanding and meaningful relationship, this proposal further solidifies that relationship for the betterment of both protocols by establishing the Balancer AMO on Fraxtal with the authorization of Frax POL for certain initial strategic pools on Balancer.

Proposal Details

Allocate a portion of Frax’s POL of sfrxETH, sFRAX, sDAI, FRAX, USDe, and sUSDe into Balancer pools on Fraxtal. The sFRAX / sDAI, sFRAX / sUSDe / sDAI, and sFRAX / sfrxETH pools will be considered core pools on Balancer.

All four pools will be eligible for BAL and AURA rewards.

Background and Motivation

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Summary:

Symbiosis is asking for an amount of liquidity from FRAX DAO to deploy FRAX Octopool (Symbiosis singe-sided cross-chain pool) among different chains to provide the ability to move FRAX among all supported chains including Fraxtal.

Currently Symbiosis has 6 type of Octopools across 30 chains:

Stable (includes USDT and USDC)

ETH (Includes wETH)

BTC (Includes wBTC, BTCB, RBTC…)

SIS

LADYS pufETH

All pools can be checked here: https://app.symbiosis.finance/liquidity-v2/pools

Symbiosis is looking to deploy FRAX Octopool among 6 supported chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum One, Avalanche, Polygon POS, Fraxtal.

Besides that, Symbiosis will integrate Fraxtal as a new chain on Symbiosis and deploy wETH pool there where Symbiosis will provide their own liquidity.

On top of that, Symbiosis will connect 1inch, OpenOcean, Izumi and other DEXs to provide routing to get any assets on those chains including frxETH, sfrxETH, FPI, sFRAX and others.

Symbiosis partners such as Li. fi (Jumper), Socket (Bungee), Rubic, Rango, OKX DEX and more will be able to integrate these pools for FRAX cross-chain transfers between different chains.

Benefits for FRAX and Fraxtal:

Symbiosis will provide solution to easily move FRAX between all popular chains similar how Circle CCTP works

Symbiosis will integrate Fraxtal a new chain and connect it to 30 chains that we support

Symbiosis will create wETH on Fraxtal and add their own liquidity there

Symbiosis will be core provider in Li. fi (Jumper) OP-stack chains cross-chain campaign

Symbiosis will connect FRAX Octopool with all popular on-chain aggregators and DEXs on chains supported by FRAX Octopool

Symbiosis partners such as Li. fi (Jumper), Socket (Bungee), Rubic, Rango, OKX DEX will be able to use this liquidity in their systems and apps

Proposal Details:

Symbiosis is asking for initial liquidity that should be provided in these single-sided liquidity pools:

FRAX Ethereum pool: $100,000 of FRAX

FRAX Polygon POS pool: $70,000 of FRAX

FRAX Avalanche pool: $50,000 of FRAX

FRAX Arbitrum One pool: $70,000 of FRAX

FRAX Fraxtal pool: $100,000 of FRAX

Below you can see how it will look like:

Integration Roadmap:

Whitelist FRAX token on Ethereum, Polygon POS, Avalanche, Arbitrum One and create  Octopool (cross-chain pool) of FRAX

Configure the relayers network to handle requests from Fraxtal in multi-chain mode

Connect Fraxtal to Symbiosis front-end, API and SDK

Motivation

The proposal seeks to introduce a new market into Fraxlend on Ethereum for wOETH.

The new market would lead to increased TVL for Fraxlend, additional revenue to the Frax Protocol and DAO from active loans and liquidations, and will attract a wider user base.

Background

Origin Ether (OETH) was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 that generates yield while sitting in your wallet. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.

Until a recent proposal, OETH was an LST aggregator that earned yield by tapping into blue-chip protocols while being collateralized by other LSTs. Over the next few weeks, OETH LST collateral will be divested back to ETH, as OETH will be transitioned into a full-fledged LST. OETH will soon become a superior LST with an extremely tight peg (1:1 redemptions to ETH thru Origin's ARM) and high yields thanks to a combination of the OETH AMO and DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p.

OETH is heavily audited by OpenZeppelin, with audits being conducted quarterly. Previous audits can be found in the OETH docs here . OETH pricing can be determined using the OETH/ETH Chainlink, Dia, or Tellor oracles. wOETH is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap OETH, you get back a fixed number of wOETH tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wOETH tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of OETH tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wOETH earns yield at the same rate as standard OETH. The wOETH to OETH exchange rate can be read from the contract (function number 16), or via the OETH dapp. wOETH contract address: 0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192

Current exchange rate as of 6/5/24: 1 wOETH = 1.09228118 OETH

[FIP - 363] Fraxlend Pilot Program with Oval on sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX,[FIP - 363] Fraxlend Pilot Program with Oval on sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX,"Jun 12, 2024 · 12:46 AM","Jun 12, 2024 · 12:46 AM","Jun 17, 2024 · 12:46 AM","Simple Summary

This proposal seeks to implement Oval into the sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX Fraxlend markets as a pilot program. Oval will enable Fraxlend to recapture liquidation MEV that is currently lost to block builders and proposers. After evaluating Oval’s effectiveness, Fraxlend can consider whether to enable Oval on other markets.

Abstract:

This proposal seeks to implement Oval into the sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX markets as a pilot program.

Oval is a liquidation MEV recapture tool composed of 2 parts:

A simple, audited smart contract that wraps an oracle price feed. This contract wrapper can not change or delay the price feed data. It only allows for new prices that create liquidation opportunities to be auctioned off to liquidators.

Offchain infrastructure that executes the auction. This is built on top of Flashbot’s MEV-Share which is a trusted MEV infrastructure leader.

Integrating Oval will allow Frax to recapture a portion of the MEV that is currently being lost on liquidations. Frax can decide what to do with their portion of the recaptured MEV (ie. return to lenders or borrowers, protocol revenue).

The sUSDe and USDe markets have been chosen as they use a single price feed that is mutable via governance and Chainlink has a USDe/USD price feed available. Oval already has pre-written and audited Chainlink adaptors, so only minor revisions are required to the Fraxlend smart oracle contract. The integration process is simple and will require minimal developer time from the Fraxlend. This pilot program will allow Frax to evaluate the effectiveness and potential scalability of Oval for broader application within its markets.

Motivation:

When a liquidation occurs on Fraxlend (and most other lending protocols), the liquidated user is charged a liquidation fee. These fees go to the 3rd party liquidator and ensure that it is profitable for liquidations to occur in market conditions that are unfavorable to liquidators. However, this often overpays for the liquidation. In these scenarios, liquidators participate in MEV by competitively bidding in an auction for first access to the profitable liquidation. The ultimate beneficiary of this is block proposers who can take up to 90% of the Liquidation Fee.

By integrating Oval, Fraxlend can run a similar competitive auction where they are the main beneficiaries, thereby recapturing the value that would have gone to the block proposer through MEV. Frax is then free to decide what to do with their portion of the recaptured MEV (ie. return to lenders or borrowers, protocol revenue).

Specification & Rationale:

What is Oval?

Oval enables liquidation MEV capture by wrapping oracle price updates as they are pushed onchain so that MEV cannot be extracted without the consent of the protocol.

With Oval, when searchers perform a liquidation on Fraxlend an order flow auction is triggered using Flashbots' MEV Share—a battle tested tool that allows MEV searchers to compete for MEV extraction offchain.

To extract the liquidation MEV created by an update, searchers must submit a winning bid, most of which is paid to the protocol as revenue. The winner of the auction gets the right to backrun the oracle update transaction—performing the liquidation by adding their transaction to the block immediately after the price update.

If no bid is received by the end of the auction window, the oracle price is automatically released and Fraxlend liquidations function as normal. This approach utilizes the solid foundation of Chainlink price feeds and MEV-Share to extract MEV from liquidations.

The diagram below showcases, at a high level, a comparison between current liquidations and liquidations with Oval.

Oracles & Oval

Oval is not a price feed oracle

Oval wraps incoming prices from oracle price feeds, shielding them from MEV searchers.

The Oval contract will use the Oracle price feed and initiate an auction for the MEV searchers to bid for access to liquidations.

If no one participates in the auction, the price update will be released after 12 seconds (1 block).

All Fraxlend logic checks on the price feed are downstream of Oval and can remain as is.

Implementation

Deploying Oval requires two simple steps:

Deploy Oval smart contracts for the sUSDe and USDe markets

Reference the Oval wrapped contracts in a new Fraxlend oracle smart contract

Update the markets oracle addresses to the new Fraxlend oracle

We recommend that Fraxlend receives their Oval revenue to a Frax treasury or governance controlled multi-sig for the pilot program. After the pilot program, Frax governance can decide how these funds should be handled and develop a smart contract solution for distributing the funds if desired.

These steps are further detailed in our docs . UMA is committed to providing ongoing support to ensure a successful implementation of Oval.

Security

To ensure the security of this system, Oval has completed an audit by Open Zeppelin and has an additional security bounty of up to $1M for any vulnerabilities that are identified.

UMA has worked closely with Flashbots to develop Oval. Flashbots has updated the MEV-Share design to add support for Oval.

This proposal aims to develop an impactful liquidity program to support

Velodrome 's expansion on Fraxtal. Velodrome's vision to expand the

MetaDEX across the Superchain is an ideal fit for Fraxtal's goals to rapidly grow its ecosystem.

This proposal asks for $1M in incentives to build deep liquidity on strategic pools for Fraxtal. Liquidity incentives are critical for bootstrapping a new ecosystem, and getting emissions flowing early will kickstart the flywheel. Deep liquidity is essential for ecosystem development, and Velodrome has a proven track record of attracting users, boosting economic activity, and retaining TVL. From there, organic activity from new DApps, users, and protocol integrations will sustain Fraxtal network activity.

Introduction to Velodrome and Superchain Vision

Velodrome's MetaDEX design is a powerful tool for bootstrapping liquidity at both the protocol level and chain layer. By bringing multiple primitives under the same roof, Velodrome provides a seamless, interactive experience for traders, protocols, and governance participants.

Velodrome has a unique flywheel design ( docs ). veVELO holders vote each week to direct $VELO emissions to liquidity pools. In exchange, voters receive 100% of swap fees and protocol incentives from the pools they vote for, creating a self-balancing mechanism that drives $VELO rewards to the most productive pools. Protocols and chains can bootstrap liquidity for their pools by depositing voting incentives. The trading volume supported by the pools will attract additional $VELO by capturing fees for veVELO voters.

Velodrome launched in June, 2022 on Optimism and has since attracted over $150M in TVL and generated >$9.2b in trading volume. Optimism has granted >5M OP grants to Velodrome to help grow liquidity and tooling for the expanding Superchain ecosystem. Velodrome has one of the most engaged and educated DeFi communities, with over 13,000 veVELO addresses who participate in weekly governance.

With its

Superchain vision, Velodrome is developing the architecture to provide a liquidity layer for the interoperable, scalable Optimism stack ecosystem. Velodrome launched its first multichain implementation on

Mode , reaching a TVL of ~$4.5m before VELO incentives are live. Velodrome has also announced plans to service BOB, Lisk, Metal and many other unannounced Superchain L2 deployments.

Proposal

Velodrome requests $1M to provide voting incentives to be allocated across the pools with the Fraxtal team's guidance. Each $1 of voting incentives would lead to roughly 1.5X VELO rewards for LPs. The incentives will be deployed over a period of 12 months, prioritizing liquidity for strategic pairs for the Fraxtal ecosystem. A draft model for the first month of liquidity incentives and pool details can be found here.

Milestones

Initial Velodrome Deployment on Fraxtal

Velodrome Superchain Beta or Superchain 1.0 (whichever is code complete) will launch on Fraxtal. Abovementioned pools will be created and liquidity will be seeded by a combination of the Fraxtal and Velodrome teams.

Emissions Go Live

Rewards will either be deposited directly or directed by veVELO voters to the original list of pools to generate the expected APRs for LPs. $5m TVL is the goal by the end of the first epoch following the start of LP emissions.

Expansion

Marketing - Velodrome will regularly highlight the APRs available for LPs on Fraxtal in order to increase awareness and bring in greater liquidity to the ecosystem. Velodrome has an active Discord server and X account with over 238,000 followers.

Business Development - Velodrome will actively seek out our existing liquidity partners that make a good fit for Fraxtal. We regularly coordinate with >100 liquidity partners (DeFi, RWAs, Perps, memecoins, etc) across the Optimism Superchain and many are interested in going multichain.

Direct voting - The Frax and Fraxtal teams can deposit POL to accrue VELO and increase veVELO voting power and boost LP rewards for select pools. $10m TVL is the goal by the end of the first month following the start of LP emissions.

Future

Velodrome’s concentrated liquidity pools, Slipstream, will be deployed for maximum capital efficiency for LPs and order execution for traders

DEX aggregator integration

Maintenance with liquidity partners on Fraxtal - coordinate weekly incentives strategy to ensure satisfactory TVLs for all stakeholders (protocols, chain, traders)

RedStone . We’ve been the major Oracle provider for Fraxtal since April 2024. Currently, our price feeds are integrated by Fraxlend, Glyph and Trinity on Fraxtal. The aim of this proposal is to help Fraxlend gain further market share and enhance its resiliency.

BACKGROUND

RedStone is the major Oracle on Fraxtal. As the only price feeds provider, RedStone offers the two major oracle implementations:

RedStone Classic - Traditional Push model, supporting 5 major pairs at the time of writing (

Here ).

RedStone Core - Pull oracle model allowing for gas efficiency, and low-latency of price feed updates, based on attaching signed data packages to transaction call-data. The model that allowed i.e. Gearbox to grow its TVL by 10x, reaching over $400M.

Our team would like to enhance Fraxlend’s resiliency by incorporating RedStone price feeds and enabling future expansions with new markets powered by RedStone (we are often the first Oracle to provide trending assets like with LRTs, Ethena, etc.).

ABOUT REDSTONE

RedStone is the quickest-growing Modular Oracle with clients including Venus, ListaDAO, Kinza, Pendle, Morpho, Ethena, Etherfi, Renzo, Puffer, Silo, Sommelier, Gearbox, Frax, Swell, Angle and 70+ other companies. Our Oracles are available on 50+ chains including Fraxtal, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Merlin Chain, BOB, Blast, TON, Mode and many more.

RedStone’s mission is to enable DeFi protocols and dApp’s builders to reach their full potential with versatile, gas-optimized and robust price feeds delivered cross-chain. Our team consists of seasoned engineers with an average of 15+ years of dev experience and a hard-working BD & Marketing team supporting partner protocols at every step: conferences, Twitter spaces, targeted intros, etc. Our technology has been acknowledged by the leading figures in the crypto space, we are proud to be backed by the most renowned Web3 Entrepreneurs such as Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon), Alex Gluchovski (zkSync), Emin Gün Sirer (Avalanche), Richard Ma (Quantstamp) and VCs like Lemniscap, Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain Capital, Maven11, Distributed Global, Lattice Fund and others.

Our tech-first approach allows us to be a leader in LRT & LST price feeds and provide Oracles for blue chip assets, LP and staked tokens and numerous trending tokens. We are the first oracle to create price feeds for weETH (Etherfi) and ezETH (Renzo), STONE (StakeStone) and numerous other assets.

PROPOSAL

Integrating sfrxETH / ETH price feed on Ethereum mainnet into Fraxlend. The feed is configured with a 0.5% deviation threshold and 6 hours heartbeat. The price discovery is set by multiplying the frxETH / ETH market price by the sfrxETH / frxETH contract’s ratio provided by Frax.

BENEFITS TO FRAXLEND

By accepting the proposal Fraxlend is going to benefit in a number of ways:

Integrating the feed would increase Fraxlend’s oracle robustness (currently it uses only a single Curve AMM to derive the frxETH / ETH rate, whereas RedStone takes all reliable sources).

RedStone would enable new markets as Fraxlend evolves.

The RedStone team will support the further cross-chain expansion of Fraxlend.

The integration would be a step for Frax DAO eligibility for the possible future RedStone rewards after TGE.

Further supporting Fraxlend on the marketing and Go-To-Market front with new assets.

The RedStone team is dedicated to continuing to help the Frax ecosystem in successful expansion horizontally (i.e support for Fraxtal and cross-chain deployments) and vertically (new assets at Fraxlend).

Background and Motivation

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Any token with an approved data feed can be lent to borrowers or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, Frax has deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Inverse Finance is the decentralized autonomous organization that develops and manages the FiRM fixed rate lending protocol, DOLA, its debt-backed, decentralized stablecoin, and sDOLA, the yield-bearing version of DOLA. Originally founded by Nour Haridy in late 2020, the protocol is governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, a collective of crypto enthusiasts. Our code base is open source and maintained by the community. sDOLA is a yield-bearing version of Inverse Finance’s DOLA stablecoin which currently generates a 30-day average yield of over 12.52% via revenues from its FiRM fixed rate lending market. sDOLA uses a custom price feed that utilizes the DOLA/FraxPyusd pool and Curve EMA to price DOLA. By adding it to Fraxlend, we can enable the minting and backing of even more FRAX and expand DOLA lending capacity against sFRAX on FiRM.

Re7 Labs, specializing in DeFi R&D and liquid crypto investment strategies has deployed the initial set of USDe/FRAX and sUSDE/FRAX markets and added them to the new Re7FRAX MetaMorpho vault.

Adding the Re7FRAX vault to the FXS gauge controller on Ethereum will allow depositors to get additional FXS rewards, increasing the supply and leading to higher borrow demand for FRAX within the Morpho Blue system. Additionally Morpho will provide MORPHO token incentives to vault depositors, contingent on a successful gauge vote.

Summary

This proposal advocates for the allocation of Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) in frxETH/ETH L1 to the YieldNest ynETH (

Audited by Chain Security ) 7x boosted vault. YieldNest will create a gnosis-safe multisig wallet where the frxETH/ETH will be received, and the ynETH will be distributed to the original deposit address from FRAX. The objective is to cement and expand the collaboration and alignment between FRAX and YieldNest. YieldNest is offering a 7x boost on

YieldNest points (seeds) (EPOCH 01) for any ETH transferred to ynETH from FRAX (Standard boost is 5x). All ynETH is also earning ETH staking rewards on top of the boosted seeds. The frxETH/ETH POL is open-ended; it is up to the team/comptroller's discretion what amount of allocation is given.

YieldNest is a Liquid Restaking Protocol (LRP) that provides simple-to-understand, risk-adjusted restaking strategies that offer user-controlled, liquid, and risk-adjusted exposure to curated AVS categories. YieldNest aims to build a long-term relationship with FRAX, explore various restaking strategies, and deploy the LRTflywheel on the Fraxtal chain for full integration with the FRAX ecosystem. See below ynETH and ynDeFi as an example AVS category that can be built with the YiledNest protocol. Try our testnet to experience the protocol.

Proposal Details:

Allocate a portion of FRAX's POL in frxETH/ETH (YieldNest will create a gnosis-safe multisig wallet where the frxETH/ETH will be received, and the ynETH will be distributed to the original deposit address from FRAX) to be deposited into the YieldNest ynETH vault for an initial period of 3 months. This will leverage the boosted yield opportunities provided by YieldNest's unique seeds program offered to FRAX. In EPOCH 01, during the first seven days, FRAX will get a 7x boost (Standard boost 5x); afterward, FRAX will get the standard two seeds per hour and potential other boosts moving forward.

Background and Motivation

YieldNest is a Liquid Restaking Protocol (LRP) that provides simple-to-understand, risk-adjusted restaking strategies that offer user-controlled, liquid, and risk-adjusted exposure to curated AVS categories. YieldNest aims to build a long-term relationship with FRAX, explore various restaking strategies, deploy the LRTflywheel on Fraxtal for full integration with the FRAX ecosystem, and develop protocol-specific Active Validated Services (AVSs) to enhance decentralization and increase capital efficiency for the FRAX protocol.

The strategic allocation to YieldNest’s ynETH vault is in line with FRAX’s objectives to maximize returns on its POL by engaging in collaborative and high-yield strategies. This initiative promises substantial returns across various market conditions and will fortify the partnership between FRAX and YieldNest, enhancing the market positions of both protocols.

Background and Motivation

FXB tokens are simple, trustless tokens that resemble a zero-coupon bond that converts to the FRAX stablecoin on maturity. FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXBs allow the formation of a yield curve to price the time value of lending FRAX back to the protocol itself.

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding new FXBs is beneficial as it expands the FRAX ecosystem's offerings, enhances liquidity, and provides users with additional tools for managing risk and optimizing investment strategies. Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Shut down Convex FRAX rETH/frxETH for an 8,300 FRAX fee.

Background and Motivation

As C2tP indicated, Convex FRAX rETH/frxETH doesn't have a migration function, but it could be shut down so that lockers could withdraw. As FRAX can't just charge a rage quit fee in this scenario, I propose the protocol to pay 8,300 FRAX to shut it down so that I can unlock my LP tokens and then withdraw from them on Curve.

Since I locked in that product 234 days ago, these have been my total claimed rewards plus my currently claimable ones: 8141,27 CRV + 67,16 CVX + 378,77 FXS. That’s a total of $7,696 as of now. I own 93% of the Convex FRAX TVL, so I would pay 8,300 (7696/0.93 rounded up) FRAX for the protocol to shut it down.

This pool has almost no volume, so the protocol doesn’t benefit in any way from me providing liquidity there. On top of that, if I can leave the pool I’d be able to provide liquidity in some other FRAX products, which would also be better for the protocol.

Background and Motivation

Morpho Blue is a decentralized protocol that facilitates overcollateralized lending and borrowing crypto assets (ERC20 Tokens) on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The protocol, designed as an immutable smart contract, serves as a trustless base layer for lenders, borrowers, and applications, with risk management layers provided by

MetaMorpho .

Re7 Labs, specializing in DeFi R&D and liquid crypto investment strategies, and other firms (to be determined) are collaborating with Morpho Blue to provide risk management services through the MetaMorpho vault system, enhancing risk management and lending vault capabilities.

Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Gearbox protocols.

Proposal Details

This proposal involves minting FRAX and depositing it into designated MetaMorpho Vaults that exclusively use sUSDe and USDe as collateral assets. The maximum authorized allocation for this action is set at 200 million FRAX. Frax AMO will initiate this process by allocating FRAX into the Re7 Vault within MetaMorpho, starting the integration of FRAX into Morpho Blue's lending markets. This strategic allocation aims to enhance liquidity and utility for FRAX within the Morpho Blue ecosystem while leveraging Re7 Labs and other future risk management firms' capabilities within the MetaMorpho vault system.

This integration will expose FRAX to the high demand for borrowing against sUSDe and USDe within Morpho Blue's lending markets, thereby increasing Frax's market share and further solidifying its position as a leading stablecoin protocol.

Introduction - Zunami Protocol Docs

Background:

Zunami is a decentralized protocol that issues aggregated stablecoins (zunUSD, zunETH), whose collateral is utilized in omnipools and differentiated among various profit-generating strategies. We create Omni pools and issue zStables on top of them. zunETH is ETH-pegged stablecoin, collateralized by LP tokens from Zunami’s ETH Omni pool and backed by ETH held in Curve pools. Our ETH Omni pool will provide liquidity to the frxETH pools on Curve, such as wETH/frxETH, stETH/frxETH, sETH/frxETH.

Motivation:

Zunami has actively supported the FRAX from the beginning, and has provided liquidity to the pools paired with FRAX and frxETH. zunETH is built using sfrxETH and pools paired with frxETH as collateral. Receiving FXS emission will allow the zunETH/frxETH pool on Convex/FRAX to increase TVL and benefit the entire ecosystem.

Implement Convex FRAX rETH/frxETH ragequit function with a 4% fee.

Background and Motivation

I own most of the liquidity in Convex FRAX rETH/frxETH, 93% of it. 219 days ago I decided to lock for 3 years, but the pool hasn't received any rewards for some time and won't receive any rewards from what I understand.

In all of this time, these have been my total claimed rewards plus my currently claimable ones: 8141,27 CRV + 67,16 CVX + 378,77 FXS. That's a total of $9,073 before fees, which is 4% of my position value. Therefore, I'd give up everything I made there over 7 months and even lose some money.

This pool has almost no volume, so the protocol doesn't benefit in any way from me providing liquidity there. On top of that, if I can leave the pool I'd be able to provide more liquidity in other FRAX pools (I'm already providing in several others), which would be mutually beneficial.

Sam Kazemian & various Frax contributors and community members

Motivation

The Frax Singularity Roadmap aims to unify all aspects of Frax into a unified vision and roadmap.  This is the first in a series of posts outlining the vision. The Frax Singularity Roadmap should be the guiding light of the Frax community.

Post-Singularity Frax Era

The launch of Fraxtal and achievement of effectively 100% CR are milestones that start a new era in Frax. Fraxtal is the substrate that enables the Frax ecosystem; it is the operating system of Frax. Fraxtal completes Frax’s core product offerings – Frax is strategically adding new subprotocols and Frax assets but all the necessary building blocks are now in place. The community can now focus on larger opportunities and paradigm shifting products as well as issuing native Frax Assets across all of the crypto universe.

In order to get here, Frax has generated $45m+ to achieve effectively 100% CR. This was a huge effort on everyone’s part, including a significant sacrifice from FXS holders to improve the overall health of Frax. The FRAX stablecoin has been largely dormant during this process and FXS revenue sharing was cut by 90% to conserve assets. That can now change entirely.

Frax: The Only Full Stack Protocol

Fraxtal is the home of Frax Nation & the Fraxtal Network State. With Fraxtal, the Frax community has a sovereign home, culture, and digital space they can call their own. This is why Fraxtal is being built. Frax already issues its own currencies & is fully governed and owned onchain by FXS stakers. Now, Frax has its own full-fledged network in Fraxtal.

Soon, L3s of Fraxtal will go online. L3s are like fractals and similar to sub-communities that have their own distinct identity & culture but part of the overall Frax Network State. They benefit from earning Frax Asset yields, RWA yields, Fraxtal settlement+security guarantees, and a constant stream of FXTL points to their L3 contract on Fraxtal based on its popularity, usage, and TVL.

All this together governed by FXS which represents an interest in the digital nation of Frax.

Fraxtal stands on the shoulders of Optimism to create one of the most developer friendly L2’s on Ethereum. While most L2's simply mirror Ethereum's incentives, we’ve gone further and innovated on base incentives to create the most compelling possible experience for developers and users - and we will continue innovating.  By owning the entire stack, Frax can introduce features like account abstraction, new precompiles, privacy functionality, aggregated DA, and Superchain interop. These features will dramatically improve the on-chain experience & make Fraxtal the preferred location to hold, stake, and transfer crypto in the coming months and years. *

With the above in mind, centralized exchanges and payment service providers that integrate Fraxtal chain deposits/withdrawals early can get allocations of FXTL points until the program concludes.

Kickstarting Fraxtal

Fraxtal's innovative Flox Blockspace Incentives have just finished its first epoch of allocating FXTL points to users and popular smart contracts.

This makes Fraxtal the only network to automatically distribute rewards block by block to users & developers for using the chain.

These incentives run for many years & will become known as a core innovation of Fraxtal as users and developers will become accustomed to earning rewards to use blocksapce, unlike any other network.

The road to $100B+ Fraxtal TVL starts now and with the target of EOY 2026.

All Frax Assets including FRAX, sFRAX, frxETH (and new Frax Assets) will be issued on Fraxtal first going forward. The Frax Core Developers are actively moving to issue Frax Assets on Fraxtal including native 4626 yield vaults, minting, and redeeming. When Frax assets reach a new ATH supply, so will Fraxtal TVL. This is a unique synergy only possible because of Frax’s full stack system.

Frax Assets will permeate every chain but the base contracts and assets will exist on Fraxtal mainnet.

Fraxtal’s Fractal Scaling Roadmap

Fraxtal is targeting 23 L3s in the next 365 days to kickstart the Fraxtal Nation community.  Frax has always taken a positive sum approach and directly supports the community and builders that integrate with us. We believe 23 L3s is the perfect number of chains that we can actively support with direct developer access/incentives/investment and more. The first two L3s are already in the works and we expect to fill the remaining spots in the coming months! L3s wil not only earn FXTL points through Flox, but the 23 L3 slots are for official partners that will get additional support from the Fraxtal Core Devs and large allocations of FXTL total supply.

If you are deploying any form of L3 or appchain and want to explore joining the Fraxtal Network State early, reach out to the Frax Core Developers & our strategic rollup-as-a-service provider partners: Conduit.xyz, Gelato.network, & Caldera.xyz to express your early interest.

Overview of Frax Assets

Frax is the only protocol in all of crypto that has 4 separate tokens/assets in the top 200. This number will only increase as will the rank of Frax Assets. Thus, it’s important to have a current overview of all Frax Assets & their utility, pegs, and design specs.

Frax Asset

Utility & Specs

Frax Share (FXS)

Governance/Staking token of all of Frax Finance, base pair of all FXS Liquidity Engine

FRAX & Staked FRAX (s)FRAX

Dollar Peg, 4626 yielding vault

Frax Ether & Staked Frax Ether (s)frxETH

ETH Peg, initial gas token on Fraxtal, 4626 yielding vault, soon to be LRT with v2

Frax Bitcoin & Staked Frax Bitcoin (s)frxBTC

BTC peg, 4626 yielding vault, fully collateralized by BTC on Bitcoin PoW chain

Frax Price Index (FPI)

Flatcoin/CPI peg, no yielding token - peg is inflation resistant

Frax Bond (FXB)

Zero coupon bond tokens that convert to FRAX on maturity similar to US Treasuries

Fraxtal Points (FXTL)

Points that represent usage of the Fraxtal blockchain to be tokenized at a future date. More details forthcoming.

All Frax Assets should be usable as the gas token on Fraxtal as the chain matures.

Potential new Frax Assets coming this year include: frxNEAR , frxTIA , frxMetis & more.

FRAX, the flagship dollar-pegged stablecoin of Frax Finance, is now effectively fully collateralized allowing us to enter the new FXS tokenomics era described below.

FXS Singularity Tokenomics

All roads lead to FXS and it is the ultimate beneficiary of the Frax ecosystem. Now that 100% CR has been effectively reached, FXS can receive all utility and benefits of the entire Frax stack. We propose that the protocol fee switch be turned back on, with 50% of the yield flowing to veFXS and the other 50% used to buy FXS and other Frax assets to pair in the FXS Liquidity Engine (FLE). The FLE will allow Frax to continue building its balance sheet while dramatically increasing liquidity for FXS and paired Frax assets. According to Defillama, even without counting multiple sources of revenue like Fraxtal chain fees and the Fraxlend AMO,

Frax makes over $40m of revenue annualized as of this writing. veFXS Revenue Share+Fee Switch Turned ON veFXS stakers will get total protocol fees at the passing of this proposal added to the veFXS yield distributor on Ethereum mainnet as well as veFXS yield distributor contract on Fraxtal soon after.

FXS Liquidity Engine will create increasing FXS POL against first Frax Assets but can and will be expanded to other voted pairs by the community.

FXS Liquidity Engine (FLE)

The FXS Liquidity Engine is a protocol owned liquidity Schelling-point of pairs of every Frax Asset against FXS. Revenue allocated to the FLE is used to buy back half FXS & half Frax Assets to increase the liquidity depth of the pair. The amount allocated to the FLE is based on the trailing price of FXS. If FXS 30-day trailing price is lower than the prior month, then 25% of protocol revenue is allocated to the FXS Liquidity Engine instead of veFXS. If the 30-day trailing price is higher than the prior month, then 25% more of protocol revenue is distributed to veFXS instead.

The long term goal is to increase the utility, liquidity, and lending credit to FXS to unprecedented levels as revenue comes in block-by-block.

Powered by Fraxswap+BAMM, these will be the initial FLE POL pairs:

FXS-frxBTC pair (more on frxBTC timelines & info in Singularity Part 2)

FXS-sfrxETH pair

FXS-sFRAX pair

FXS-FPI pair

FLE gauges will be releasing soon to power different FLE pairs including bespoke FLE pairs. FLE gauges that go live with this vote: FXS-frxETH, FXS-FRAX.

This liquidity engine is entirely on Fraxtal mainnet and nowhere else so Frax profits directly increase Fraxtal TVL, liquidity, & lending capacity in real time.

Frax Finance revenue to FXS and the FXS Liquidity Engine is not cyclical and generates consistent revenue through all market cycles to increase POL constantly in all macro conditions. When volatile assets go down in value, revenue from FXBs and (s)FRAX should increase revenues. Thus, the FLE should be a constant, direct value add to FXS holders and stakers alike.

Note: there are certain strategic assets that will be kept on the balance sheet/treasury including CVX (staked as vlCVX), cvxCRV, cvxPRISMA, & cvxFXN, among other assets that will be added as “strategic assets” in future governance votes. These strategic assets will not be sold or distributed to veFXS holders nor sold to power the FLE.

Frax Core Team

Summary

This proposal suggests retiring the outstanding Harmony addresses for the canFRAX and canFXS tokens following the security breach of the Harmony’s Horizon Bridge in 2022.

Background and Motivation

Frax Finance previously utilized the Harmony Horizon Bridge to facilitate the transfer of FRAX and FXS tokens to the Harmony network, resulting in the creation of canFRAX and canFXS tokens. Unfortunately, in June 2022, the Harmony Horizon Bridge was compromised in a significant security breach , resulting in the loss of a substantial amount of FRAX and FXS tokens that backed the canFRAX and canFXS tokens circulating on Harmony One Network.

The security breach of the Harmony Horizon Bridge was a severe incident that led to the loss of user funds and undermined trust in the integrity of the Harmony bridge. Frax Finance believes that it is Harmony's responsibility to reimburse the FRAX and FXS tokens lost in the bridge due to the security breach, rather than burdening Frax Finance with the obligation to reimburse users. While Harmony has created some form of repayment and restitution program for hack victims, it has fallen dramatically short of reimbursing anywhere near the full loss of the Harmony Bridge hack even nearly 2 years after the fact. That is why we believe full responsibility lies on Harmony. Frax Finance is a direct victim of the Harmony Bridge hack just like all affected users.

Proposal Details

Given the circumstances surrounding the security breach of the Harmony Horizon Bridge and the loss of FRAX and FXS tokens backing canFRAX and canFXS, it is proposed to retire the outstanding tokens for canFRAX and canFXS tokens. Users that hold these tokens can and should seek remediation from Harmony rather than Frax Finance. Frax Finance itself is a victim of the situation and not culpable for liability of a breach it did not cause nor deserve. By retiring canFRAX and canFXS tokens and asking holders of these tokens to directly seek restitution from Harmony, the Frax Finance ecosystem will be strengthened and a burden removed from the protocol’s balance sheet that was never its own fault or doing. canFRAX

Background:

Convergence is an agnostic “Convex-like” layer, currently deployed atop Stake DAO. In addition to the well-known “Convex-like” behavior of aggregation/optimization of underlying protocols, Convergence also gathers mechanisms inspired from Curve, and Olympus. Gauges and veTokenomics are used to drive emissions, and a

Bonding Program has been established. Bonds are used to build Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) and a treasury that allows Convergence to ensure self-sustainability, but also to reward token holders with an intrinsic incentive mechanism that does not rely on underlying protocols’ aggregation.

Convergence’s main products are: a boosting layer for Curve LPs via Stake DAO a yield-bearing locked primitive that acts as a Curve ecosystem index (ysCVG) a governance aggregator (mgCVG)

Motivation:

Convergence’s liquidity consists of 2 pools (CVG/WETH and CVG/FRAXBP), where the liquidity is almost entirely owned by the protocol as

Protolcol Owned Liquidity .

The CVG/FRAXBP pool is a secondary pool, which purposes are the following: allowing users to buy CVG using stablecoins; being a farming venue for the treasury which will accumulate CRV CVX and FXS rewards that will be distributed back to ysCVG holders.

Thus, we are looking for a gauge on Frax to maximize earnings from the CVG/FRAXBP pool. The LP will be max locked on Convex/Frax, and vote incentives will be offered to veFXS holders on Votemarket. As previously mentioned, 80% of farmed rewards will be distributed back to CVG lockers who chose to lock their tokens for ysCVG.

Below, you will find math showing weighted calculations outlining the USD Value at time of emission of how many rewards the current and proposed-to-be-unlocked-TVL received.

Additionally, you will find the grand total of all rewards ever given.

I performed the following calculations in line with my previous work on the StakeDAO Frax Eth Put pool, which makes the following assumptions: the LP was max locked and then subject to linear decay until present time. The calculations only account for the boost of the proposed-to-be unlocked LP.

Total $value$ upon emission of lifetime rewards to entire pool = $1,105,164.7725

Total USD of all FXS rewards emitted to 4.769m LP valued at time of emission, using Max Boot of 3.0 with linear decay : $268,122.224 $268,122.224 / 4.769m = 5.6%

Summary

Use 100,000.00 vlCVX to vote for fxUSD/FRAX LP gauge on Curve Finance. f(x) Protocol will match Curve Incentives for this LP by utilizing part of the veFXN owned to vote on f(x) Protocol gauge .

Background

The f(x) Protocol is a DeFi solution that addresses the need for a stable asset in the cryptocurrency space while mitigating centralization risks and capital efficiency issues. f(x) Protocol was conceived by Aladdin DAO; the US banking crisis in March 2023, combined with the depegging of USDC, highlighted the need for a new type of decentralized, highly scalable stable asset.

Initially, f(x) Protocol introduced a new concept called a “floating stablecoin” or fETH. fETH is not pegged to a fixed value, but rather gains or loses a fraction of the price movements of ETH. This allows fETH to hold its value well in any market condition.

When f(x) Protocol first launched in August of 2023, f(x) introduced the DeFi world to something special: a powerful new defi primitive centered around a complimentary token pair. The f(x) pair, or “stable-leverage pair” primitive is based on a simple concept: split a yield-bearing token (called the base or reserve token) into two parts: a low-volatility (i.e. stable) part and a high volatility (i.e. “leveraged”) part, both tokenized. Stable tokens can be staked in a rebalancing pool to earn yield from the reserve tokens, while the high volatility tokens protect the peg simply by existing, themselves providing a remarkably simple, safe, and cheap way to take ETH leverage.

As the protocol has gained attention and adoption, our community highlighted the need of a fully decentralized and hard pegged stablecoin. After extensive discussions and governance process, Aladdin DAO is now prepared to introduce f(x) Protocol’s new USD-pegged stablecoin, fxUSD.

As a stablecoin, fxUSD offers four key features never before combined:

Built-in yield, derived from LSDs in the reserve

Scalability: rapidly scalable based on direct demand

Stability: reliable peg in both directions, backed by f(x)’s invariant

Resilience: collateralized by Ethereum LSDs, with zero real-world asset exposure

At genesis, we are choosing 5 stablecoins to pair fxUSD with: FRAX (Frax Finance), crvUSD (Curve Finance), pyUSD (Paypal), DOLA (Inverse Protocol) and GRAI (Gravita Protocol). We are aiming for all these pools to have double gauges, on Curve and f(x). Each partner will either use owned vlCVX or veCRV to vote for incentives on Curve’s gauge or will incentives veFXN votes on f(x) Protocol’s gauge.

Motivation

Increasing liquidity and visibility for the fxUSD/FRAX pool is critical to the operation of f(x) Protocol. It would also be beneficial and additive to the ecosystem in the following ways:

Having higher rewards will incentives more users to deposit in the pool, getting more FRAX deposited;

Having a deeper pool will help stabilize FRAX’s peg; fxUSD is backed in part by frxETH; attracting more deposits will increase the minting of fxUSD, thus increasing frxETH supply.

Proposal

In order to create a deeper pool and to attract liquidity which will support fxUSD - FRAX swaps we propose that Frax vote with 100,000 vlCVX/ epoch for the fxUSD/FRAX pool for the next 12 epochs on Votium. In exchange, f(x) will use treasury owned veFXN to vote on f(x) Protocol gauge in order to match Curve’s rewards for the same duration.

For : Use 100,000.00 vlCVX to vote for fxUSD/FRAX LP gauge on Curve Finance for 6 months.

Against : Do nothing.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0x7ccad1489bc722c666096250c929e1f7b7c2ae66430aaa1c1e8386a1c482bd8c

Background:

Inverse Finance is an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization that develops and manages a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial products using blockchain smart contract technology. Originally founded by Nour Haridy in late 2020, the protocol is now governed by Inverse Finance DAO, a collective of crypto enthusiasts.

Inverse Finance’s main products are:

FiRM, a fixed-rate lending market

DOLA, a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar sDOLA, the yield-bearing version of the DOLA stablecoin

DBR, a new DeFi primitive that enables holders to service a DOLA loan on FiRM.

DOLA is a debt-backed USD stablecoin which is added into and removed from circulation;

On the supply side of money markets, such as DAO-owned protocol FiRM, by Inverse Finance's “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.

Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA/FraxBP (currently $8.6M TVL), DOLA/USDC on Velodrome ($1.9M TVL), DOLA/USDC on Balancer ($2.4m TVL on ETH, $2.2m TVL on Arbitrum) and DOLA/USDbC on Aerodrome ($14m TVL).

Motivation:

To provide additional liquidity paired with the new Frax metapool, Frax/Pyusd, using $INV bribes. Inverse has a long and close relationship with Frax, having supported the DOLA/FraxBP for 1.5 years, DOLA/Frax pools on Arbitrum and Optimism chains, and the soon-to-launch sFRAX collateral market on Inverse Finance’s fixed rate lending market, FiRM. Given this relationship, it is rational to further support join initiatives such as the new DOLA/FRAXPYUSD pool to further deepen on-chain liquidity for the DOLA and Frax stablecoins.

Background

Hourglass is excited to announce HFXB, the first ever index of Frax Bonds (FXBs). HFXB is designed to aggregate secondary liquidity for FXBs while improving their composability across the DeFi ecosystem. It will also manage FXB rollover and rebalancing for users that aim to maintain exposure to a particular FXB duration. While this post will discuss a particular implementation of HFXB (which benchmarks an average ~6 month duration), Hourglass Frax Bond Indices can theoretically target any duration along the yield curve.

HFXB’s smart contract design resembles an asynchronous ERC-4626 vault, whereby users can periodically deposit sFrax to mint shares of the vault. This sFrax is then deployed via a rebalancing strategy such that the vault’s average duration is within a margin of the target duration. Shares minted from the vault, otherwise known as the HFXB token, can be freely traded on Curve, redeemed for the underlying, or otherwise be composed across DeFi. HFXB vault rebalancing will happen on the most efficient market it can find, whether that be the individual FXB pools on Curve or the time-bound token marketplace on Hourglass. Further details about HFXB can be found in the documentation .

Motivation

HFXB is designed to drive meaningful locked liquidity to the Frax protocol by deepening FXB secondary liquidity and simplifying its user experience. Rather than Frax needing to maintain unique liquidity pools on Curve and Fraxlend for each duration FXB, each of which require periodic rollovers, the protocol can incentivize a small number of indices which perpetually facilitate price discovery and liquidity for the Frax yield curve. This has the added benefit of improving FXS incentive efficiency, and as such we propose that HFXB is added to the gauge controller.

Summary

Whitelist the Alchemix DAO Multi-sig to stake veFXS

Background and Motivation

Alchemix has long admired Frax and viewed them as a partner, sharing many synergies in the way we approach scaling our protocols. Frax was the inspiration for our AMOs, which are currently our largest driver of revenue to the DAO. We recently migrated our largest AMO from alETH-ETH to alETH-frxETH on Curve. Alchemix also provides FRAX and frxETH vaults, allowing self-repaying loans on these assets, and further utility for holding them. Since the days of the D4 pool, our protocols have been working together with co-incentives to provide additional yield to our LPs and to service additional synthetic alAsset demand from our users. Currently Alchemix and Frax maintain partner pools on Main net, Arbitrum and Optimism, and provide co-incentives on a majority of pools together.

In addition to direct incentives, Alchemix has long been accumulating and locking CRV, CVX and various other liquidity-driving assets to help scale the size and effectiveness of our pools. (see https://alchemix-stats.com/ for details) Now that the majority of our AMOs operate on pools that pair alAssets with Frax assets, we would like to begin locking FXS as well. In order to do so at the DAO level, we need to be able to lock from our multisig. This will allow us to increase the efficiency of our joint pools, further align incentives between our protocols, and continue to foster an already great relationship between our teams.

Thank you for your consideration.

[FIP - 327] Onboarding Frax to tfBILL,[FIP - 327] Onboarding Frax to tfBILL,"Feb 3, 2024 · 9:57 AM","Feb 3, 2024 · 9:57 AM","Feb 8, 2024 · 9:57 AM","Frax Community,

Given recent conversations surrounding treasury management preempting the upcoming launch of FXBs in 2024, we wanted to formally introduce ourselves as Adapt3r Digital, the General Partner of tfBILL, our on-chain treasury bill product. We are proposing an initial maximum allocation limit of $20 million to tfBILL, in line with Centrifuge’s recent proposal.

Executive Summary

With the passing of FIP-308, Frax will be able to onboard to a diverse set of on-chain T-Bill issuers.

There are nuanced yet significant differences between the options today, with the logical intersection for Frax being those that can maximize for liquidity and regulatory compliance. tfBILL was structured for institutional scale since the underlying collateral is spot T-Bills ($700B global daily volume) rather than ETFs (<$400mn global daily volume). Tokenized ETF products will present significant frictions in liquidity and hidden fees for a balance sheet as large as Frax due to the potential slippage when FXBs are scaled (i.e. $100mn+ redemptions are not frictionless). tfBILL was also structured to minimize regulatory risk and thus maximize flexibility. Given our cautious approach to integrations, we are free to operate both domestically and abroad, including with FinresPBC

MJL Capital, our direct affiliate, is also heavily aligned with Frax given our position of a long-term holder and staker of FXS in our hedge fund strategies. As such, we are open to receiving fees partially paid in FXS token. tfBILL is a purpose-built, scalable, already live solution that allows direct access to U.S. Treasury Bill yields so that protocols can leverage all of the benefits of RWAs. Users deposit USDC into a smart contract vault, obtaining tfBILL tokens representing Limited Partner interest in a BVI-registered fund holding exclusively treasury bills. The entity, designed for bankruptcy remoteness, assures investment security with full legal recourse for tfBILL holders. Launched in September 2023, the vault currently accepts USDC deposits from KYC'd non-U.S. investors, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of ~$8,600,00 and an estimated yield of 5.32%. We can adopt any structure that aligns with FRAX requirements/goals and have the flexibility to provide both onshore and offshore US operations. If FRAX decides to operate in the US through FinresPBC, we have the capacity to participate. Importantly, we are fully compliant and have a clean cohort of investors in our fund. No anonymous users today. tfBILL differentiates itself through compliance-focused strategies, emphasis on regulated counterparties, enhanced transparency via on-chain Net Asset Value attestations, and on-demand liquidity. Utilizing battle-tested smart contracts from TrueFi ensures robust security and operational independence. tfBILL redefines simplicity, transparency, and security in on-chain treasury instruments.

Overview

Our flagship product, the

Adapt3r Short-Term U.S. Treasury Bill Fund , offers on-chain stablecoin holders 24/7, direct access to US Treasury Bill yield. Upon depositing USDC to the smart contract vault, investors are issued tfBILL tokens which represent Limited Partner interest in a BVI registered professional fund that exclusively holds treasury bills. The entity is bankruptcy remote and solely owned by the holders of tfBILL, who have full legal recourse to tfBILL’s underlying securities. The vault is built on TrueFi’s open, transparent, and battle-tested smart contracts and is conveniently offered on Archblock’s institutional-grade frontend marketplace.

The vault was deployed in September 2023 and currently accepts USDC deposits from KYC’d non-US investors. At the time of writing, the TVL of the vault is approximately $8,600,000 and offers an estimated yield of over 5%. tfBILL was built in response to compliance and complexity concerns we continually heard from DAOs and on-chain investors about existing treasury bill offerings. Specifically, many DeFi entities and users expressed difficulty evaluating existing options due to contrived and opaque legal structures with uncertain investor recourse, hidden layers of fees, and aggressive operation in regulatory “grey areas.”

Since the beginning, the primary goal has been to build an on-chain treasury instrument that is simple, transparent, and secure for all users. Here are some of the key ways tfBILL differentiates itself:

Compliance-focused: A tokenized asset is only as strong as the regulatory position of its issuer. Given treasury bills are US securities, tfBILL complies with all applicable regulations (i.e. SEC Reg S), only accepting qualified non-US investors with rigorous controls in place. We are in the process of establishing a US feeder fund which will enable direct access to US investors such as Frax.

Simply T-Bills: tfBILL is directly backed by treasury bills purchased through and custodied by a regulated broker-dealer in the United States. The Fund does not allocate to ETFs which offer greater volatility, higher tracking error, lower liquidity, more counterparties, and higher fees. By purchasing treasuries directly, tfBILL has access to far greater liquidity with over $700 billion in average daily volume to sell/buy into versus less than $400 million for treasury ETFs like SHV.

Enhanced transparency: Adapt3r Digital has gone one step further than most to ensure the underlying backing of tfBILL is open and accessible to all. Everyday the third-party Fund Administrator provides Net Asset Value attestations, which are subsequently uploaded on-chain and to IPFS. These capital updates are required for fees to be taken from the vault. In every on-chain update the manager includes the Net Asset Value of the fund (and thus tfBILL tokens), the underlying positions/CUSIPs, and the source PDF that the Fund Administrator provides. This same data file is used to update our Transparency Board. Finally, the Fund is audited on an annual basis by Wolf & Co.

On-demand liquidity: tfBILL is mintable on-chain through Archblock’s interface, utilizing TrueFi’s smart contract architecture. This interface is open 24/7 and currently accepts USDC, but can be expanded to other stablecoins and chains with little friction.

Battle-tested smart contracts: Single points of failure are the hidden risk embedded in every tokenized asset. By using TrueFi’s battle-tested smart contracts, which have facilitated almost $2 billion in lending volume to date, tfBILL has achieved two significant milestones that differentiate us from all other players in this space: 1) offering a new tokenized asset without compromising on the smart contract level and 2) offering enhanced protections and controls by separating the front-end, blockchain, and d’App from the manager of the product itself. Unlike other treasury bill primitives, TrueFi’s underlying infrastructure is independent from Adapt3r’s operations and is always on.

Flow of Funds Diagram

In conclusion

Ultimately, Adapt3r Digital and our affiliate, MJL Capital, are deeply aligned with the Frax mission and purpose. We want to see the project succeed. If you are looking to learn more about tfBILL check out our documentation or reach out via DM or email.

Pricing and payment

The pricing for this proposal is structured to streamline fees. The potential usage of FXS as also helps to align incentives towards long-term interests versus short-term benefits. The fee structure is as follows:

Portfolio Fee

0.30% p.a. on assets in tfBILL up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M

0.30% is paid on an ongoing basis to Adapt3r, payable in stablecoins and/or FXS tokens. The difference between 0.30% and the effective fee is rebated from Adapt3r back to Frax on an ongoing basis.

Protocol Fee

0.20%

This fee is currently on holiday and not applicable to Frax’s potential investment.

Frax Core Team

Summary

This proposal suggests the introduction of a 10% protocol fee on Fraxlend, Frax Finance's lending platform. This initiative is aimed at aligning Fraxlend more closely with industry standards, particularly the practices of major players like Aave, and leveraging its value to support our goal of achieving a 100% Collateralization Ratio (CR) for the FRAX stablecoin.

Background and Motivation

Since its inception, Fraxlend has operated without a protocol fee, focusing on growth and user acquisition. However, as we evolve and aim to fortify our financial stability and service quality, introducing an protocol fee becomes essential. Setting an protocol fee at 10% positions Fraxlend competitively in the DeFi lending market and generates revenue that can be reinvested into the platform and the FRAX ecosystem.

Proposal Details

Smart Contract Compatibility: Our existing Fraxlend smart contracts are already equipped to support this fee structure, allowing for a smooth implementation process. Protocol fee is a percentage of interest which goes to Frax Finance DAO.

Fee Implementation: Introduce a 10% protocol fee across all lending pairs on Fraxlend.

Revenue Utilization: The revenue generated from this fee will contribute to the stability and growth of the FRAX stablecoin, aiding our pursuit of a 100% Collateralization Ratio.

Proposal

Authorize $370,000 in base funding (50% FRAX/50% FXS priced at 30 day avg.) and $200,000 in extra incentives over the next 12 months to support Flywheel in our media, education, and outreach efforts for the Frax ecosystem.

Background

Since our inception in June 2022 until now, Flywheel has evolved from a single podcast to a full-fledged subDAO of Frax that specializes in media, education, and culture. The Frax Core Team is unique among its contemporaries as it does not prioritize growth/marketing internally, choosing to invest resources in technological development and research. Flywheel has stepped up to fill this void in a grassroots manner. In a world of mercenaries, Flywheel stands out as a missionary proving ourselves many times over not only of our loyalty but effectiveness in spreading awareness of Frax far and wide. With Fraxtal (Fraxchain) around the corner, Flywheel's role in Frax will only grow in importance and will give us an opportunity to expand the surface level of our coverage and outreach.

In 2024, our goals are to:

Transform passive observers into active participants in the Frax Ecosystem.

Cultivate a vibe for Frax that people can identify with and have positive feelings toward.

Solidify Flywheel as the educational and cultural backbone of Frax.

Plans for 2024

Last year, how our grants were structured were on a per-task basis. This year, we will list the general responsibilities that Flywheel will be executing on behalf of Frax as well as to keep its own house organized. In order for Flywheel DeFi to still function and operate at the level it does now, then we must be able to fund itself properly. Funding from this grant will be able to support a staff of 6 people which include myself as DeFi Dave (CEO, Core Advocate), Sam McCoulloch, (Executive Producer), Kiet Fong (CFO, Co-Host), Peepo (Media Editor), Carissa Campo (Growth Lead), and Phil Lewy (Content Specialist):

Summary

Proposal to add Aave V3 aFRAX pools on Arbitrum to the FXS gauge controller.

Background And Motivation

Adding the Aave V3 aFRAX pools to the FXS gauge controller on Arbitrum is a strategic move by Frax Finance to enhance its market presence. Additionally, the FXS gauge’s ability to distribute ARB tokens positions it as a vital instrument for Frax Finance to allocate current and future grant-funded incentives within the ecosystem efficiently.

Frax Finance Core Team

Summary:

This proposal seeks governance approval to whitelist FXBs (Frax Bond Tokens) in the Frax Curve Automated Market Operator (AMO) with a maximum allocation cap of 5 million FRAX per FXB, aiming to diversify Curve AMO strategies and enhance yield opportunities.

Background and Motivation

FXBs, as new products in the Frax ecosystem, are unique utility tokens that convert to FRAX stablecoins at a set maturity date. These trustless, zero-coupon bond-like tokens are entirely backed by FRAX, providing a yield curve and pricing the time value of lending FRAX back to the protocol. By including FXBs in the Frax Curve AMO, we aim to diversify Curve AMO strategies and support the adoption and growth of this innovative product. This integration aligns with our commitment to fostering a robust and versatile DeFi ecosystem.

Documentation: https://docs.redacted.finance/ and https://dineroismoney.com/docs

Background: pxETH is ETH liquid staking token (“LST”) developed by the Redacted Protocol as part of its Dinero Protocol offering. It is a liquid and fungible receipt token for ETH deposited into the Dinero protocol which is then staked and used to run validators for the Ethereum network. Users can deposit their pxETH into an auto compounding pxETH vault in exchange for an apxETH vault token which benefits from Ethereum staking rewards and other revenue forms such as MEV tips and block rewards. Future apxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH and apxETH can be found in the whitepaper here . pxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future, an incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals from the protocol, especially when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.

Motivation:

To provide additional immediate pxETH liquidity, the Redacted DAO is incentivizing DEX liquidity for pxETH, using governance power in its treasury and BTRFLY bribes. Redacted has a long and close relationship with Frax - it has one of the largest DAO FXS holdings and has a veFXS bribe market on hidden.hand, Redacted’s bribe market.

Given this close relationship, pairing frxETH on LPs makes immediate sense, and would allow Redacted to have a closer relationship with Frax whilst helping grow its pxETH product, together with frxETH.

Implement Curve VST/FRAX Gauge ragequit function with a 20% fee.

Background and Motivation

In recent weeks, our community has actively engaged in discussions and voting regarding implementing a ragequit function for the VST/FRAX pool's FXS Gauge on Arbitrum. Two previous proposals, featuring a

0% fee and a 7% fee respectively, were put forward but did not align with the community's expectations and precedents set in similar scenarios. Recognizing this, several community members have approached the Frax core team, advocating for a new proposal that aligns with the routine fee structure observed in comparable cases. This has led to the suggestion of implementing a 20% ragequit fee, a rate that mirrors the standard fee applied in analogous situations within our ecosystem (e.g.

Saddle L2D4 Gauge ).

Background:

The TricryptoFRAX pool is a modern take on Curve’s tricrypto pool, and contains FRAX, tBTC, and frxETH. This proposal aims to add a gauge for Convex wrapped positions of the TricryptoFRAX pool. tBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin, backed 1:1 by mainnet BTC, and maintained by Threshold DAO. Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a network of nodes using threshold cryptography. tBTC is permissionlessly redeemable for mainnet BTC.

Motivation:

The TricryptoFRAX pool is a permissionless and decentralized way for Frax users to move BTC in and out of DeFi. Threshold DAO aims to build a relationship with the value-aligned Frax community, to offer decentralized BTC DeFi usecases.

Executive Summary

This is a proposal to onboard the Frax protocol to Centrifuge Prime, for the purposes of contributing to a differentiated and resilient RWA capability within FraxDAO. Onboarding to Centrifuge Prime will create a dedicated pipeline of resources and assets to serve the Frax protocol. If accepted, this proposal will establish a debt ceiling of $20M to be established for the Anemoy LTF, a BVI registered and regulated US Treasury fund.

Centrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWAs on as collateral. Notable firsts include minting MakerDAO’s first real-world asset, structuring the first on chain securitization, launching the RWA Market with Aave, and partnering with BlockTower to bring the first credit fund operations on chain. Centrifuge Prime is built for the needs of large decentralized organizations. It provides the infrastructure and services to quickly and easily onboard and scale a fully diversified portfolio of real-world assets. Through Centrifuge Prime, decentralized organizations can get access to an institutional ecosystem of RWA partners and service providers to curate a portfolio of assets across their desired risk profiles.

Centrifuge is a DAO-governed protocol. k/factory contributes to the Centrifuge protocol by providing development, and infrastructure, and working with users to ensure adoption.

Description

This proposal will:

Work with FraxDAO to establish a legal conduit for RWA investments

Allocate to $20M of collateral to the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund

Facilitate diversified and relevant investment opportunities for Frax

The Legal Conduit

Centrifuge Prime utilizes a legal framework to provide an effective and resilient setup for RWA investments. We have collaborated with Frax community members on this framework, and this proposal will seek to use the protocols existing infrastructure for facilitating these investments.

A descriptive diagram of the Centrifuge Prime legal framework is included below for reference.

This framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar structures . There, the same structure supports a >$1B in deployed capital.

Anemoy LTF

The Anemoy LTF is a purpose-built onchain offering combining lowest possible credit risk with fast liquidity and low fees. Centrifuge as the tokenization and issuance protocol offers a programmable DeFi-native integration.

The LTF provides an onchain RWA product that offers:

Real-time transparency: Each position in the portfolio is tokenized and represented onchain, allowing for near real-time transparency into the portfolio’s overall status. Integrations with price oracles, onchain verifications, and programmable execution will allow this to be the most transparent product in the market today.

Legal recourse and investor protection: The offered token is an actual fund share using the ability to tokenize a fund under BVI law. The token itself represents ownership and not only the accompanying legal framework. Token holders have direct claims to the underlying assets in the fund, (US Treasury bills) and an ability to request a redemption in-kind to receive actual T-Bills. The combination of owning a share of a BVI-regulated fund with all AUM held with a regulated US custodian and traded through a registered US prime broker offers investors the highest-quality recourse and protection. Low fees: Unlike most other offerings, the fund holds T-Bills directly in its own account, saving investors fees charged by the ETF issuers or other intermediaries.

More information on Anemoy and the LTF can be found here .

Diversified Investment Opportunities

Centrifuge Prime also provides dedicated access to the Centrifuge ecosystem and community. As part of this proposal, the Centrifuge team will work directly with the community to ensure that the available RWA portfolio meets Frax’s needs.

The

Centrifuge Credit Group , a DAO entity setup to provide risk and credit analysis, can be utilized to provide general-purpose reporting for the assets invested. This provides an additional level of ongoing monitoring and independent analysis that Frax can utilize.

Beyond US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the Frax DAO to allocate into the following asset classes:

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Summary

Implement VST-FRAX Gauge ragequit function with 7% withdrawal fee.

Background and Motivation

The Vesta-Frax VST-FRAX pool was a popular stable pool on Arbitrum, contributing to liquidity provision and stablecoin swaps. However, the protocol is set to wind down in Oct 17 2023 as seen here .

In light of these developments, this proposal seeks to introduce a “ragequit” mechanism to the VST-FRAX Gauge on Arbitrum, allowing lockers to exit the pool without a penalty. This feature will offer liquidity providers an organized route to withdraw their assets from the pool, considering the evolving context driven by sunset of Vesta protocol.

I recreated this proposal because discussion has fizzled out about it and no new proposal has arisen, all while many people's liquidity (including mine) is held hostage by Frax due to the will of the few managing Convex governance.

Why 7% fee?

Lockers respected all their obligations and willingly made a commitment to Frax, and while I feel it is unfair to charge any withdrawal fee in this case, this proposal will not pass without one, leaving us hostage. Considering lockers are equally being deprived of many years of yield they were promised, a 7% fee should be a reasonable amount to pay for the early unlock of these assets.

If anyone feels this should be higher, feel free to discuss it, preferably before this goes to Snapshot.

Axelar Foundation

Frax Finance Core Team

Summary

This proposal suggests that Frax Finance utilizes Axelar network, a leading cross-chain platform that can facilitate the seamless bridging of FRAX and other Frax Finance assets to chains where a Frax Ferry doesn't exist. In furtherance of this proposal, Frax Finance commits to refraining from launching a Frax Ferry to the specified chains, instead adopting Axelar network’s solution (e.g., axlFRAX) as the representation of Frax Finance’s assets on those chains. To be clear, axlFRAX is not technologically secured by the Frax Protocol, but is technologically secured by the decentralized Axelar network.

Background and Motivation

Frax Finance has gained substantial recognition for its innovative stablecoins, FRAX, FPI, frxETH, and yield-bearing tokens, sFRAX and sfrxETH. As we continue to expand our presence in the DeFi landscape, interoperability across multiple chains becomes crucial. While we've successfully launched Frax Ferry on various chains, some chains may lack a dedicated Frax Ferry. This poses challenges in providing liquidity and accessibility to users on those chains.

Axelar network, a fully decentralized, open-stack cross-chain solution, offers a reliable and efficient means of bridging assets across different blockchain ecosystems. By utilizing the Axelar network, Frax Finance aims to overcome the limitations posed by the absence of a Frax Ferry on certain chains, ensuring that Frax tokens remain accessible, tradable, and functional in diverse blockchain environments. Frax Ferries requires a substantial amount of infrastructure and engineering effort on the team’s part. Thus, it makes sense to work with a reputable cross-chain network to expand FRAX issuance on the “long-tail” of chains.

Proposal Detail

This proposal suggests that Frax Finance adopts Axelar network’s representation of Frax Finance tokens on chains where a dedicated Frax Ferry is unavailable. This adoption will enable the seamless transfer of Frax Finance tokens between supported chains.

Future Chain Inclusion

To maintain transparency and community involvement, any requests to adopt axlFRAX on new chains will require a governance proposal. This proposal should outline the reasons for inclusion and provide a clear rationale for extending axlFRAX to additional chains. Community members will have the opportunity to vote on these proposals.

Governance Proposal for Ferry Launch

It is important to note that Frax Finance maintains the flexibility to launch a Frax Ferry on the specified chains if deemed necessary. However, any such launch will be subject to a new governance proposal and approval from the Frax Finance community.

Voting

For: Support for the adoption of Frax Finance bridged tokens by the decentralized Axelar network on specified chains.

Background:

JPEG'd is a decentralized lending protocol that issues Ether/Stablecoin derivatives backed by NFTs as collateral. All debt is fully collateralized, and underwritten by the full backing of the JPEG'd Treasury. pETH is an ETH-pegged stablecoin that is loaned as debt to be repaid against NFT collateral. Our pETH-frxETH pool provide liquidity to the frxETH pools on Curve.

Motivation:

JPEG'd is a regular customer of Frax through FRAXBPpUSD, and would like to stake more of our liquidity on Frax for the mutual benefit of both DAOs.

Background:

Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.

USD+ by Overnight Finance

USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.

Motivation:

We propose the addition of an USD+/FraxBP liquidity pool to the FXS gauge controller. This integration will aim to leverage the popularity and stability of both USD+ and FraxBP tokens, potentially enhancing liquidity, stability, and overall engagement in the Frax ecosystem.

Increased Liquidity : The introduction of an Overnight Finance USD+/FraxBP pool can attract more liquidity providers, hence making the Frax ecosystem more robust.

Diversification : A diversified set of assets and partnerships, such as with Overnight Finance, strengthens the resilience of the Frax ecosystem against market downturns.

Alignment with Frax's Vision : By supporting stable assets like USD+ and FraxBP, Frax reiterates its commitment to stability and decentralization.

Incentivizing Holders : The addition of this pool to the FXS gauge controller can incentivize holders with additional FXS rewards, thus encouraging longer-term holding and engagement.

Summary

Implement VST-FRAX Gauge ragequit function with 0 withdrawal fee.

Background and Motivation

The Vesta-Frax VST-FRAX pool was a popular stable pool on Arbitrum, contributing to liquidity provision and stablecoin swaps. However, the protocol is set to wind down in Oct 17 2023 as seen here .

This feature will offer liquidity providers an organized route to withdraw their assets from the pool, considering the evolving context driven by sunset of Vesta protocol.

Why 0 fee?

Prior wind down efforts such as this implemented the rage quit with a 20% withdrawal fee. The VST-FRAX pool should not wind down with the same amount of fee because this is not merely a wind down of the pool structure, but rather this is a wind down of the asset in the pool.

Vesta's wind down will decrease the supply of the VST stablecoin to 0. Starting on Oct 17, 2023, a PSM with USDC will be opened and redemption will be enabled. The PSM will allow users to swap VST for USDC on a 1:1 basis. Redemption will allow any third party users to close anyone's vault position in Vesta. By enabling lockers to withdraw, they will be able to also participate in the redemption process, helping VST fully wind down instead of leaving potentially substantial amount of residual VST in the pool.

Furthermore, early lockers locked into the pool because of high amount of emission enabled by Tetranode's vote. Given the protocol wind down, Tetra is shifting his vote elsewhere, decreasing the pool's emission to 0. By adding a withdrawal fee, current lockers who entered with the expectation of high emission will be left with 0 reward for the rest of the lock duration, decreasing the lockers' faith in Frax's gauge system. Furthermore, Tetranode will likely move the reward to a new gauge, which people can move into and lock again. Asking for a high withdrawal fee will discourage people from locking in new gauges in the future.

Background & Motivation

Arrakis Finance and Arrakis LST Vaults

Arrakis Finance is a non-custodial on-chain market-making protocol that builds both the infrastructure and the strategies that enables and execute sophisticated algorithmic market-making on Uniswap V3.

Arrakis LST Vaults are permissionless and incentivizable LP infrastructure that provide algorithmic market-making strategies for LST assets. They are designed to solve the critical challenges that LST protocols and LPs currently are facing:

High cost for maintaining deep liquidity

Deep liquidity is crucial for LSTs as staying tightly pegged on the secondary market is what qualifies a liquid staking token liquid. Traditionally, it is exceedingly expensive to maintain sufficient liquidity depth and protocols have spent tens of millions worth of incentives for it.

Arrakis LST Vaults on the other hand tackle this issue via high capital efficiency with minimal capital requirement. Leveraging the concentrated liquidity feature of UniV3, the strategies use limit orders, asymmetric liquidity, and algorithmic rebalancing to minimize price impact for larger trades and therefore make liquid staking tokens actually liquid. This means that LST protocols can reduce their expenditure on liquidity mining incentives since less capital is required now to establish a liquid market.

IL (Impermanent Loss) risk for LPs

LPs are in constant struggle between earning liquidity mining incentives and taking on IL risk. The amount of IL risk is directly correlated to the size of the exposure the liquidity has to the market.

Arrakis LST Vaults mitigate IL risk by managing the amount of liquidity exposed to the market at any particular moment for both bid and ask prices. This approach minimizes the likelihood of engaging in excessive buying and/or selling at unfavorable prices, hence reducing the IL risk.

How Frax can benefit from it

First of all, even though both frxETH and FRAX already have quite deep liquidity on their own, the direct liquidity for frxETH/FRAX is rather thin and poorly managed at the moment. Arrakis LST Vaults can help increase the liquidity depth of frxETH/FRAX while only requiring limited capital and incentives.

Secondly, frxETH is mostly paired with ETH or other LSTs, and FRAX is mostly paired with other stablecoins. A liquid market of frxETH/FRAX can efficiently route the swaps between frxETH and other stablecoins or between FRAX and other LSTs, which will lead to wider circulation of frxETH and FRAX.

Furthermore, LP positions in Arrakis LST Vaults can act as collaterals and be integrated into lending markets.

Arrakis has been assisting Frax with liquidity management since Arrakis V1 product, and we would like to strengthen this long-term relationship with more and better services that can further benefit the Frax community.

Proposal

Grant $30k of FXS to fund building the MVP for the sticker protocol and premiere demo of it at ETHDenver 2024 or at a future event when Fraxchain is live.

Background and Motivation the sticker protocol prints digital stickers, imbues them with value, and facilitates the swapping of stickers across the web

Stickers are frxETH-backed non-fungible digital objects that can be traded IRL and around the social web, as collectibles, memorabilia, and visual reactions. Because stickers communicate emotions and not explicitly value, the traditional mental transaction costs associated with social micropayments are eliminated and financial value piggybacks on our natural emotional reaccs.

When people receive stickers as reactions to posts or messages in chats, they can choose to keep them—perhaps this sticker is from a dear friend, or perhaps it’s from a rare early set—or burn them to receive the backing frxETH, realizing the monetary value embedded within.

As non-fungible stores of frxETH, stickers have an insane monetary premium and therefore increase the monetary premium of frxETH itself. Yield from the frxETH embedded in the sticker protocol is automatically redistributed amongst participants and stakeholders by the protocol.

Stickers are an adhesive art form, a unique medium of creativity and social expression that helps the p2p web stick together.

During the FraxBUILD Hackathon, the Sticker Protocol came in first in the Consumer Adoption category. So far, only smart contracts have been created for it. The purpose of this is to build out a full-fledged MVP with the goal of launching a first edition of the project next year on Fraxchain.

By funding this project, it will act as a way for frxETH to increase in market share from the angle of social demand rather than purely economic incentives all while using the Frax protocol as the underlying primitive.

Technical Details

What follows is a summary of the technical details outlined in this notion doc, so click through to see the full details. https://oneofthemany.notion.site/sticker-protocol-v1-d332f46051d14c88b43378bc0706741e

The Sticker Protocol

The sticker protocol is deployed on Fraxchain because of a) L2 gas for nft transfers, naturally, and b) built-in sfrxETH staking, which ensures that the protocol’s frxETH reserve is instantly available for redemption. The sticker protocol itself receives and redistributes the aggregate yield in the following ways:

20% to finders, those that facilitate the printing of stickers (minting platforms, social apps)

10% to Adhesive, LLC, the core dev entity responsible for building the protocol

70% to Stick Together, an on-chain collective

Stick Together is an on-chain collective tasked with facilitating the stickers ecosystem. As the primary recipient of sticker yield, it has a vested interest in the flywheel effect (pun intended) of printing more stickers and increasing the velocity of an individual sticker. Stick Together is also the administrator of the very few parts of the protocol that are governance-integrated, namely how yield is distributed.

Stick Together will use much of its earnings to subsidize or eliminate gas costs for onboarding and transfers, based on a variety of heuristics, proof-of-personhoods, etc. The goal is to remove gas costs for the long tail of users. It could also use its revenue to retroactively incentivize platform integrations, fund grants, and more. Initially it will be a simple multisig, foundation-style, but could be expanded to include a governance token.

Individual sticker minting (‘printing’) logic is controlled by Printer implementation contracts provided by artists. The sticker protocol makes it trivial to deploy and index these contracts for a unified experience over the set of all stickers in the ecosystem while allowing artist-controlled collections.

The User-Facing PWA

A mobile-first PWA for printing, collecting, and trading stickers. Gas for onboarding, inviting, and trading is sponsored by Stick Together. Session keys and account abstraction means users sign in with anything and never need to manually approve a transaction. Fund your sticker wallet directly, by (liquidity) bridge, or with Moonpay.

The app is invite-only, and all invites include a set of pre-printed stickers, ensuring that everyone on the network has stickers to swap. Invites can be generated by Stick Together or individual users can invite a friend by printing stickers on their behalf.

The app will support inventory management, activity feeds, and a polished send/receive flow to support an IRL launch at a conference in the future.

Scope and Timeline

The scope of work consists of:

User research and brand design

Landing Page Design & Development

Smart Contract Development

Consumer PWA Development

Quality Assurance & Testing

We estimate that an MVP will take 3-4 months to complete. Upon completion, we will showcase the product on Flywheel DeFi in a video feature explaining and demoing it to the wider community. $30k will be paid out in FXS. $15k will be sent after the proposal passes, $10k will be sent upon release of MVP feature on Flywheel, and $5k will be sent before ETHDenver. Of the grant money, $25k will be used to fund development and $5k will be used for promotional activities at ETHDenver.

We intend to launch The Sticker Protocol on Fraxchain so if for whatever reason Fraxchain is not live by ETHDenver, we will wait for the next relevant conference to have an event promoting it.

Proposed MVP Launch Plan

In a perfect world we’d like to launch The Sticker Protocol at a conference with the following experience: attendees onboard using our mobile-optimized PWA and receive many duplicate editions of a single sticker from the genesis sticker pack. they’re then incentivized to trade between other attendees to collect the full set:

Users scan each others QR codes to open a trading interface between each other where they can swap stickers in real-time (imagine dragging and dropping a sticker at the top of your device where a wormhole catches it and teleports it to the other person — they receive it moments later and the new sticker places itself gently into their collection).

Assembling a full set of the genesis pack also grants them an event-exclusive set of stickers that will surely be a massive flex in the future. all gas will be sponsored and account-abstracted away for the world’s smoothest experience. one of the many matts— the guy with the NFT-dispensing chip embedded into his hand —and Defi Dave (and perhaps others!) will also have some custom stickers to give away to those who meet them IRL. Furthermore, we can collaborate with relevant influencers and brands to create and distribute their stickers as well.

Summary

This proposal introduces Staked FRAX (sFRAX) into the Frax ecosystem, allowing users to deposit FRAX stablecoins into a smart contract (Standard ERC-4626) and earn interest (denominated in FRAX stablecoins) on their holdings. Similar to the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) concept, sFRAX focuses on addressing the near-zero duration yield curve of FRAX, providing users with an opportunity to earn passive FRAX stablecoins while contributing to the growth of FRAX supply. sFRAX is not a guarantee of any yield or right to any redemption of on-chain or off-chain assets other than the FRAX stablecoins deposited and earned.

Background and Motivation

The concept of sFRAX aims to bridge the gap in the yield curve of FRAX by offering a low-duration savings option for users in a compliant ERC4626 token standard to integrate into protocols, bridges, cross-chain applications, and other useful places that can hold sFRAX and earn more FRAX stablecoins passively at the “Frax Staking Rate.” This will let users earn interest on FRAX stablecoin holdings without the risk associated with longer-duration onchain strategies. By introducing sFRAX, we envision an enhanced stablecoin ecosystem that encourages users to participate in earning rewards while stabilizing the protocol's supply dynamics. This move also aligns to promote greater liquidity in the protocol.

Details of sFRAX

The sFRAX contract will allow users to deposit their FRAX stablecoins to earn APR on their deposited FRAX holdings through earning newly minted FRAX stablecoins. Upon depositing FRAX, users will receive sFRAX tokens reflecting their proportional pool share (this is similar to the sfrxETH token). These tokens can be freely traded or transferred, allowing users to manage their yield-bearing assets effectively and for projects to build on top of sFRAX knowing that it is always akin to a yield-bearing FRAX stablecoin token.

Frax Protocol will deposit the generated yields into the sFRAX Vault on a weekly basis. This consistent weekly deposit mechanism ensures that users' sFRAX holdings continue to accrue APR over time. The source of yield for sFRAX is not static or guaranteed to be from a single strategy. The protocol will allocate part of the revenues it earns from balance sheet deployment in AMOs and RWA strategies to supplying sFRAX yield to set the “Frax Staking Rate.” It will attempt to softly target (but not guarantee) the Federal Reserve Interest on Reserve Deposit Rate (IORB) at all times. If the protocol cannot return as much yield as the IORB, it will always attempt to keep the FRAX stablecoin fully collateralized 100% CR first, then return excess balance sheet revenues to sFRAX at the soft-target of the IORB (other than the current launch period where sFRAX has the current APR).

Proposal

Grant Flywheel $12.5k to help subsidize completed website upgrade costs.

Background

Flywheel DeFi has established itself as the premier content destination for anyone looking to enter the Frax ecosystem. From our weekly programming to curation of community initiatives such as FraxBUILD and the Frax Educational Initiatives to our IRL events, we view Flywheel as an extension of the Frax ecosystem and it is our core mission to spread the Frax gospel far and wide.

Motivation

Recently, Flywheel rebuilt its website to better reflect its mission and ambitions. We proudly display our commitment to Frax on the homepage and have multiple sections dedicated to Frax education and awareness. Screenshots that are in this proposal that exemplify this include:

Heatmap of Flywheel homepage that shows Frax 101 is the most clicked-on item

Frax 101 section that is filled with links to explainers, tutorial videos, and more technical documentation

Frax Alpha section in articles for people to keep up to date with the latest updates

Link to Frax education incentives for people to participate in it

The total cost for the site was $25k, however, we are requesting to have the website partially subsidized by the Frax DAO.

Flywheel has become the go-to resource for people who want to learn about Frax. This retroactive grant would be a sign of support from the wider community and assist us in continuing to do our work.

Background and Motivation

While the Frax Ferry has played a crucial role in facilitating cross-chain transfers for FRAX, specified chain has experienced low transfer volumes, which do not justify the operational effort required to maintain the Ferry for it. It's important to note that Frax Finance remains committed to the mentioned chain ecosystem and growth. However, in light of the current circumstances, we believe that supporting this chain through third-party bridges is a more effective approach. This will allow users to continue enjoying the benefits of cross-chain transfers while optimizing resource allocation.

Sunset Process Details

Phased Transition:

Transfers from Ethereum Mainnet to the specified chains will be gradually phased out. Users will be informed that transfers for these specific chains will no longer be supported starting from a predefined date.

UI Removal:

Following the phased transition, the user interface for the Ferry for the specified chains will be removed from the main Frax APP after a period of three months . This will provide users with sufficient time to adjust their strategies and make informed decisions.

Token Retrieval : Although the Ferry interface will be removed from the UI, users who have transferred FRAX tokens to the mentioned chains will still have the option to retrieve their tokens. By engaging with the Frax Finance team, users can initiate the process to return their tokens from the specified chains back to the Ethereum Mainnet.

Transfers from Ethereum Mainnet to the specified chains will be gradually phased out. Users will be informed that transfers for these specific chains will no longer be supported starting from a predefined date.

UI Removal:

Following the phased transition, the user interface for the Ferry for the specified chains will be removed from the main Frax APP after a period of three months . This will provide users with sufficient time to adjust their strategies and make informed decisions.

Token Retrieval : Although the Ferry interface will be removed from the UI, users who have transferred FRAX tokens to the mentioned chains will still have the option to retrieve their tokens. By engaging with the Frax Finance team, users can initiate the process to return their tokens from the specified chains back to the Ethereum Mainnet.

Background and Motivation

While the Frax Ferry has played a crucial role in facilitating cross-chain transfers for FRAX, specified chain has experienced low transfer volumes, which do not justify the operational effort required to maintain the Ferry for it. It's important to note that Frax Finance remains committed to the mentioned chain ecosystem and growth. However, in light of the current circumstances, we believe that supporting this chain through third-party bridges is a more effective approach. This will allow users to continue enjoying the benefits of cross-chain transfers while optimizing resource allocation.

Summary

Implement Saddle L2D4 Gauge ragequit function with a 20% fee.

Background and Motivation

The Saddle L2D4 pool was a popular stable pool on Arbitrum, contributing to liquidity provision and stablecoin swaps. However, the recent approval of

SIP-54 on August 14, 2023, which decided to responsibly wind down the Saddle protocol, leads to a reevaluation of the operational aspects of the Saddle L2D4 pool.

In light of these developments, this proposal seeks to introduce a ""ragequit"" mechanism to the Saddle L2D4 pool Gauge on Arbitrum, designed with a 20% fee structure. This feature will offer liquidity providers an organized route to withdraw their assets from the pool, considering the evolving context driven by sunset of Saddle protocol.

Proposal to add the Curve frxETH/WETH to the FXS gauge controller.

Background And Motivation

Building on the momentum of

FIP - 229 , which extended FXS gauge eligibility to pools and vaults with frxETH, we now have an opportunity to stimulate further growth of frxETH.

This initiative is a strategic element of our growth plan for frxETH. By leveraging Convex’s proficiency in enhancing yield for Curve LP positions, we seek to stimulate more substantial growth and adoption of frxETH. The inclusion of these pools not only augments the utility of frxETH but also brings diversification and resilience to our strategy.

Summary

This FIP proposes to acquire CRV using FRAX DAO treasury funds to support Frax's role in DeFi and increase liquidity across all FRAX/FrxETH/FPI pairs and rebalance part of FRAX DAO’s treasury funds.

Background and Motivation

Curve Finance has garnered significant attention for facilitating efficient stablecoin trading. The recent exploit within the Curve Finance ecosystem, coupled with market dynamics, has led to a favorable CRV token price. This presents an advantageous window to accumulate CRV tokens.

By acquiring CRV tokens through an OTC deal, Frax aims to solidify its presence within the CRV ecosystem and tap into the growth potential of Curve Finance. This strategic move is driven by a forward-looking perspective that anticipates the expansion of Curve Finance and the potential value it can bring to Frax's ecosystem.

Proposal

This proposal suggests the OTC acquisition of CRV tokens using 1 million FRAX from the Frax DAO treasury at the same price as the prior OTC transactions conducted by Curve founder Mich. The acquired CRV will not be sold but instead staked in veCRV (through Frax’s whitelisted locker) and/or staked in cvxCRV. The CRV acquisition will enhance Frax's presence within the curve ecosystem and position the protocol for future growth.

Sam Kazemian

Background

The Frax Protocol needs a method to hold cash deposits and other low-risk cash-equivalent assets (such as reverse repo contracts and treasury bills) in order to execute its FRAX v3 RWA asset strategy. The Frax Core Developers have been working to create traditional financial infrastructure that can serve this purpose.

Earlier this year, Financial Reserves and Asset Exploration Inc (dba

FinresPBC ) was incorporated in the US state of Delaware as a public benefit C corporation to accomplish this mission.

FinresPBC has been set up to be a conduit to accomplish this task for the Frax Protocol. FinresPBC is not a for profit entity: its incorporation documents state that its public benefit mission is to bring traditional financial assets (colloquially known as ""RWAs"") onchain for the benefit of the public. Thus, any yield generated from assets it holds on behalf of Frax Protocol will be returned to the protocol (minus costs/fees incurred to operate the public benefit business). Therefore, FinresPBC’s public mission is to provide the Frax Protocol access to safe cash-equivalent assets and near Fed rate yields for the benefit of all without seeking to make profit from this relationship or charge fees (other than to pay for minimum costs related to serving its mission). Additionally, FinresPBC's mission is to continue expanding its traditional infrastructure including meeting requirements for a Federal Reserve Master Account (FMA) in the future.

FinresPBC does

NOT partake in any Frax Protocol development, smart contract engineering, or in any way participate in Frax Finance operations.

FinresPBC’s involvement and relationship to the Frax Protocol is solely restricted to holding cash-equivalent reserves and/or issuing token representation of such reserves. FinresPBC is

NOT a developer lab or corporation responsible for or maintainer of the Frax Protocol smart contracts/open source code.

FinresPBC does

NOT partake in any additional for profit activity or hypothecate reserves held for the Frax Protocol.

FinresPBC is not a profit maximizing organization. It's sole public benefit mission is to give onchain users access to offchain ""cash-equivalent RWAs."" FinresPBC will not hypothecate, lend, pledge, or conduct business activity outside of its sole public mission to provide onchain access to offchain RWAs.

FinresPBC's current banking partner is Lead Bank (lead.bank) an innovative regional bank that has opened its doors for crypto businesses to conduct safe, compliant traditional financial activity. FinresPBC is actively expanding its banking and financial relationships with compliant & crypto friendly financial partners (including full-service banks) and will announce new partners as appropriate. Any traditional financial entity that is interested in exploring a direct relationship, please reach out directly.

Currently, FinresPBC is capable of conducting the following for the Frax Protocol:

1.) Hold US Dollar deposits in FDIC Insured IntraFi savings accounts & earn yield on such accounts.

2.) Mint/Redeem Paxos USDP stablecoins & earn yield.

3.) Mint/Redeem Circle USDC stablecoins & earn yield.

4.) Hold/Purchase/Sell United States Treasury Bills in segregated brokerage accounts & earn yield.

Reporting, Auditing, & Attestations

No later than every month, FinresPBC will give a full asset breakdown and report of all reserves it holds for the Frax Protocol including expanded view of yields it has earned on such reserves as well as maintenance fees/costs incurred to hold such reserves and conduct such transactions.

Reports will be published publicly on this forum & sent to the Frax Core Developers to publish on Frax Facts and relevant protocol front end data sources deemed appropriate by the community.

Summary

Approve FinresPBC to be FRAX v3's Offchain Partner & Custodian for the above mentioned transactions.

Summary

Whitelist Flywheel DeFi multi-sig to stake veFXS

Background and Motivation

For over the past year, Flywheel DeFi has been pioneering grassroots community involvement in the Frax community. We have been keeping our finger on the pulse on development, created comprehensive educational resources, and have played a major role in helping people understand Frax and ultimately onboarding them into the Frax ecosystem. Whitelisting Flywheel DeFi is a logical next step in increasing our involvement with the protocol.

As part of the grants we received from the Frax DAO, we have received a large portion of funding in FXS, accumulating a respectable stack. We at Flywheel want to take a bigger role in the governance of the Frax ecosystem which we can only do if we are whitelisted. We believe we are in a unique position at the nexus of community and advocacy to properly represent the will of those who decide to delegate to us. In addition, we would like to be able to put our idle FXS to work by staking it directly into veFXS, capturing the upside of protocol growth and further aligning incentives between us.

Introduction - Zunami Protocol Docs

Background:

Zunami is a decentralized protocol that issues aggregated stablecoins (UZD,zETH), whose collateral is utilized in omnipools and differentiated among various profit-generating strategies. We create Omni pools and issue zStables on top of them. zETH is ETH-pegged stablecoin with a rebase mechanism, collateralized by LP tokens from Zunami's ETH Omni pool and backed by ETH held in Curve pools. Our ETH Omni pool provide liquidity to the  frxETH pools on Curve, such as alETH/frxETH, stETH/frxETH, sETH/frxETH.

Both zETH and UZD are pool-aware tokens, meaning that when they are held in a Curve pool, the rebase feature is disabled, and all earnings are directed towards incentivizing that pool through bribes. This approach creates a self-sustainable economy, propelling zStables to the top of profitability charts.

Motivation:

Zunami actively supports the FRAX  and the evidence of our commitment lies in the value we already bring to the FRAX ecosystem through our UZD stablecoin:

TVL of our UZD/FRAXBP pool has surpassed $6 million, making us the 4th largest pool among FRAXBP pools.

We hold the position of being the largest briber on Votium among FRAXBP pools.

Our USD Omni pool has allocated over $3.2 million to pools paired with FRAXBP.

With the achievements we have accomplished so far, we are confident that we can replicate and amplify the same successes with frxETH.

Background:

Gravita is a borrowing platform based on Liquity that is focused on bringing interest-free borrowing to liquid staking token holders. Borrowing occurs by minting GRAI, the debt token of Gravita, which is burned when debts are repaid. Over-leveraged borrowers are liquidated via a stability pool, where GRAI holders can deposit.

References/Useful links:

Gravita Website -> https://www.gravitaprotocol.com/

Gravita Documentation -> https://docs.gravitaprotocol.com/gravita-docs/

Motivation:

Deep liquidity for GRAI helps both to stabilize the price and facilitate borrowers. GRAI price will be further stabilized in the future with a redemption mechanism similar to Liquity. However, the system functions much better if the redemption mechanism is rarely used. Sourcing liquidity between GRAI and stablecoins like FraxBP is the primary bottleneck to the growth of Gravita and will be where the majority of resources go for the foreseeable future. That will start with protocol revenues, then governance tokens when the token launches.

Frax Core Team

Summary

This proposal aims to grant the Fraxlend AMO permission to distribute its existing allocation limitations among both V1 and V3 FraxLend lending pairs. The main objective is to ensure a smooth migration from V1 to V3 by maximizing the utilization of the allocations already in place across both versions.

Background and Motivation

As we're getting set to launch more lending markets with Fraxlend V3 with Variable Rate V2, it's key to reexamine our capital allocation game plan to ensure a seamless move from V1 to V3. Currently, each Fraxlend V1 lending pair has its own allocation caps managed by Fraxlend AMO. But, with the upcoming arrival of new lending pairs in V3, we need a solid plan to manage these allocations effectively. This proposal aims to offer a smooth transition from V1 to V3, keeping user-experience top-notch and our platform running smoothly.

Details

Our proposal is to give Fraxlend AMO the power to share its existing allocation limits between V1 and soon-to-launch V3 lending pairs. In simpler terms, the allocation cap for a specific lending pair could be shared between its V1 and V3 versions. By spreading these allocations across multiple versions, we can make the best use of capital and offer a hassle-free transition for our users.

The pairs we plan to roll out in V3 are:

Proposal to add the Curve GHO/FRAXBP to the FXS gauge controller.

Background And Motivation

AAVE DAO has reached quorum on their final vote to launch GHO, their protocol's stablecoin. It will go live on 15 July, 2023. Frax DAO should pre-vote a gauge for the Curve pair so FXS incentives can be distributed on launch day.

Additionally, this vote should bypass the 7 day discussion period and immediately go to vote to be live by July 15.

Summary

Proposal to add the Fraxlend optimizer Fraximal vault token to the FXS gauge controller

Background and Motivation

Fraximal is a vault on

Sommelier , an innovative asset management protocol whose mission is to make DeFi more accessible, profitable, and efficient for everyone. Sommelier’s advanced technology built on the Cosmos SDK enables intelligent vaults that can optimize portfolios, trade long-short, borrow-lend, and farm. Independent strategists can leverage the power of off-chain computation to inform on-chain vaults, allowing vaults to dynamically adapt to market conditions and provide enhanced opportunities and risk mitigation to users. All vaults are enabled by smart contracts audited

0xMacro and controlled by protocol governance, ensuring transparency and security.

The Fraximal Facts.frax vault linkvault is different from other vaults in that it is intelligent, meaning it has the ability to predict, react, optimize and evolve to DeFi conditions whereas other vaults are static and limited to simple functions like auto-compounding or lending a single asset to one pool. The vault uses these intelligent capabilities to provide Frax depositors with the optimal yield available for collateralizing FRAX on Fraxlend. This is achieved through advanced modeling of past and real-time data from Fraxlend including interest curves, available liquidity, borrowed liquidity, and loan characteristics.

It can be complex, gas intensive, and time consuming to constantly track and react to the Fraxlend market movements. Fraximal aims to provide depositors with a simplified option to receive optimal yield on their FRAX while simultaneously being beneficial to the Fraxlend protocol. Increased FRAX deposits to Fraximal leads to more FRAX lending on Fraxlend. Deep liquidity on Fraxlend benefits the protocol in a number of ways including more liquid borrowing pools and a smoothing of borrow costs in high utilization pairs, both of which increases usage of Fraxlend.

The Fraximal vault launched on July 5th, 2023 and as of July 8th has attracted $1.3M of Frax liquidity and is the 7th largest lender on the protocol. The approval of an FXS gauge would aim to assist in attracting additional liquidity to the vault.

TBD

TBD

Background and Motivation

With the addition of the recently approved steth Curve AMO, I wanted to start a discussion on adding a new market to Fraxlend.

Sfrxeth/steth

This pair would let people wrap and get leverage on their lsd positions. The supply asset is sfrxeth and the borrowed asset is steth, which has a lower average APR. With a high LTV of 90%, we could enable 10x leverage on the interest rate differential. High LTVs would bring higher leverage, but I think it would be wise to see how the pair preforms during liquidations.

On the LTV, since these are interest rate differential products, I could see the LTV going up to 98% once the market develops enough. 10x is a good start, but high leverage is needed for good rate products.

Its beneficial for both parties and also for generating more revenue for the protocol. With the new AMO providing liquidity into the steth/frxeth lp there should be enough liquidity to handle liquidations.

I want to start this thread to start researching what demand might look like for this pair and also get feedback on lending parameters.

We also could add a sfrxETH/reth pair, which would be more profitable because the rETH yields are always the lowest. However, there is no rETH AMO and so liquidity issues could arise during liquidations.

I propose the implementation of a 20% ragequit function (similar to FIP -196) for the FRAX/DAI Gelato Uniswap Pool to address the needs of community members who wish to re-allocate their capital.

Implementing such a function represents a negligible risk to the protocol as the pool barely has any trading volume since May 2022. Furthermore, the TVL of the pool has only decreased since April 2022, leaving the pool currently at ~$2.9M TVL. Both facts highlight that the pool has had minimal adoption, making it an ineffective and non-productive way to direct capital.

With a 20% ragequit fee, community members will be allowed to exit their position and direct their capital to more productive avenues.

Additional Information

It is important to note that the Gelato network no longer looks after G-UNI pools as it was spun out into Arrakis Finance. There have also never been additional incentives for the gauge from Gelato's side.

Background And Motivation

Metronome 's msETH is a synthetic ETH asset that allows users to take on multiplied exposure to ETH and ETH-like yield without risking USD price volatility of ETH. Among other assets, Metronome supports sfrxETH as collateral, and with over $2mm in sfrxETH TVL on the application (roughly 25% of all TVL), the Frax community has certainly taken an interested in our protocol to amplify their yield and take out capital efficient, fixed rate loans against their various Frax positions.

Metronome controls a significant CVX position and is additionally sending out significant bribes each epoch towards liquidity, including the msETH/frxETH pool.

Summary

Increase grant allocation from $214.2k to $267.2k ($53k total) to account for additional activities of Flywheel. Change the receiving of funds from llama Pay stream and lump sum at the end of the year to monthly payout, basing the price of FXS on the 30-day TWAP average from Fraxswap.

Background

Since the passing of our grant renewal earlier this year, Flywheel has continued to provide intangible value to the Frax ecosystem. Along with staying consistent with our flagship media content, we have shepherded a number of initiatives including:

Hosting events and increasing awareness of Frax around the world which has received wide acclaim from attendees. These events allow us to connect with builders and spread awareness of Frax to users.

Organizing the Frax Ecosystem Education Program that has encouraged outsider contributors and researchers to proliferate Frax beyond Flywheel

Organizing and leading the FraxBuild Hackathon. Along with rallying developers to build in the Frax ecosystem but also interact with the core team in a meaningful way through workshops and office hours.

A recent example Flywheel’s outsized impact to the Frax ecosystem was its key role in proliferating the Fraxchain news. What started as a conversation with Sam K on Flywheel we were able to package into a digestible story that was picked up by major news outlets and further discussed by key opinion leaders. Projects often hire whole marketing departments and PR firms in attempts to capture the same type of coverage yet Flywheel was able to do effortlessly due to the consistency of our content and firm long-term commitment to Frax.

Furthermore, as promised in our last grant , we have started to diversify our revenue streams. In April of this year we received an $18k education grant from Frax ecosystem partner Brain DAO, are in the beginnings of selling merch, and started consulting. We continue to actively look for education grants that align with our mission of promoting the Frax ecosystem.

Review of Current Use of Funds $104k to Flywheel

Our flagship podcast Flywheel has continued to release episodes weekly. On this program, we have invited a wide-range of key opinion leaders ranging from builders to traders and everyone in between. Although this may not explicitly cover Frax, we perform what I like to call open-source advocacy with the guest whether it's explaining Frax to them or brainstorming collaborations on air. We have been able to hire a professional editor to help us streamline the process. $52k to Frax Check

We have stayed consistent with releasing weekly Frax Checks that review the performance of the protocol. $25k to IRL Events

Flywheel has been consistent in hosting events around the world. So far we have hosted happy hours in Denver, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Seoul as well as a panel and workshop at Zuzalu. Coming up, we are planning events at Waterloo, Paris, and in NYC but after that our budget here will be almost if not depleted. $15.6k in business development representation

Although The TIE shuttered its SigDev portal program, DeFi Dave has still led and assisted Frax in business development activities. These efforts range from introducing the core team to prospective projects who want to enter the Frax ecosystem to representing Frax in Twitter Spaces and at future conferences such as Stable Summit and ETHcc. $10k for Frax-branded merchandise

Flywheel has created signature Frax merch for Denver and Tokyo and will continue to do so for future events. We will reallocate the money unused from Frax branded NFTs toward this category. $5.1k for art and content

Flywheel has used these funds to help create memes and fund for our Frax 101 efforts (deep dives, tutorials, and explainers). $2.5k for Frax-branded NFTs

After further research, we decided not to pursue this path. This money will be reallocated towards merch for the future.

Proposal Details

Items in Grant

Events budget

Events have proven to be an effective method of reaching out to the wide DeFi community and beyond in real life. Although we are halfway through the year, Flywheel has hosted 5 separate events and have 3 more planned in Waterloo (happening this week), Paris and New York.

Although we have more events planned, we are asking for another $15000 with the aim of hosting at least 2 more events in Singapore for Token2049 and Istanbul for DevConnect (totaling 10 for the year). Any extra funds available will be used to fund future meetups that have not been planned yet.

This Week in Frax and Frax Check

Shortly after the passage of our last grant, we started releasing a new program called This Week in Frax which covers the events and conversations in the Frax Ecosystem over the past week.

We propose to allocate $1000 per episode for This Week in Frax and change the cadence of Frax Check to a biweekly basis starting June 27th which totals $36000 .

SamKazBot

Before Flywheel, SamKazBot was famously touted as the “only tool used for Frax marketing”. At the beginning of the year, the bot went offline due to maintenance issues. In light of this, Flywheel took the initiative to rebuild and launch SamKazBot in May 2023.

For this work and future work, we propose to allocate $2000 for SamKazBot’s revival and maintenance.

Amendment of payout

Change payment from LlamaPay and lump sum at the end of the year to monthly basis starting in July. Split payment between FRAX and FXS 50/50 and use a 30-day TWAP that is at the discretion of the Frax Core team.

With the additional $53k, the total amount for the grant will be $267.2k.

Paid monthly starting July 8th, 2023, the total compensation will be $22.66k per month.

Motivation

This proposal aims to help Flywheel continue to function effectively as the media extension of the Frax ecosystem. By amending the payout, it will help Flywheel to continue to operate without a hitch and compensate us for completed work and future iniatives for the rest of the year.

The FRAX allocated towards this proposal is well within Frax’s budget that has allocated $600k towards grants. In addition, we continue to align ourselves with the protocol by having half of the grant paid in FXS.

Frax Core Team

Summary

This proposal seeks to establish percentage-based allocation caps for the frxETH Curve AMO allocation in frxETH curve pools. These caps, defined as a minimum and a maximum allocation cap for each pool, will guide the team's allocation decisions.

The proposed allocation caps for frxETH Curve AMO are:

Current Allocation: frxETH/ETH: Max 100% Min 100%

Proposed Allocation: frxETH/ETH: Max 100% Min 50% frxETH/stETH: Max 50% Min 0%

This means the team is mandated to maintain at least 50% of the allocation of the frxETH Curve AMO (withheld ETH) in the frxETH/ETH pool at all times but can allocate up to 50% to the frxETH/stETH pool if it is deemed advantageous.

It is important to clarify that the min/max caps specified in this proposal are separate from the ""withholding ratio."" The caps are not intended to suggest that we are directing 100% of all ETH minted from frxETH to the AMO. The withholding ratio of ETH is a separate parameter. These max/min caps are put in place to govern the portion of the withheld ETH that will be allocated to the frxETH/ETH and stETH/frxETH pools within the AMO. more information about the current frxETH balance sheet can be found in

Frax Facts .

Background and Motivation

Automated Market Operations (AMO) make Frax Finance one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism. In Frax Ethereum, most of our Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) resides on Curve, so setting clear allocation caps is crucial for managing our liquidity effectively and transparently in frxETH Curve AMO.

Our current Frax Ethereum portfolio is primarily based on the frxETH/ETH pool, which has served us well thus far, ensuring liquidity and stability for our operations. However, as we cast our sights toward future expansion and robustness, it becomes essential to explore other potential avenues for diversification. stETH, being the largest and most demanded liquid staking derivative (LSD) on the market, brings a significant value proposition to the table. It provides liquidity nearly the same as ETH while generating an attractive yield, making the inclusion of stETH/frxETH a beneficial addition to our holdings.

Therefore, the aim of this proposal is to set allocation caps that balance the benefits of incorporating stETH LP tokens into our portfolio while maintaining a strong position in our existing frxETH/ETH pool

5% of the FXS supply is in the hands of the Core Team Treasury to be deployed for the sole purpose of growing the Frax Protocol to become one of the most important cryptocurrency projects in the world.

In order to achieve that mission, we propose staking 4.5m FXS in veFXS for 6 months to attain yield and allocating that yield. We will use the veFXS yield to fund expansion of the team, bringing onboard community moderators/business developers/outreach, new developers, and create the Frax Grants+Incubator Program. The remaining 500k FXS not staked will be used for similar initiatives. This allows the treasury to fund these programs regardless if veFXS yield crashes or if there is a protracted bear market, allowing the Frax Protocol to continue its mission of becoming one of the most important protocols no matter what.

After 6 months, this exact proposal (with any modifications/adjustments) will go live for another community vote before further allocation of funds so that the project team & extended contributors are held accountable to FXS tokenholders.

The core team will

NOT VOTE using the staked veFXS or treasury address so this proposal will NOT affect the team's ability to sway governance in any way.

Background

The Frax Team Treasury is composed of 5m FXS. This treasury has largely been dormant for the first year of the Frax Protocol. Now that almost all FXS tokens have been released other than the community allocation through gauge emissions, we propose kickstarting the allocation of this treasury in a strategic manner to exponentially grow the pace of FRAX development & further decentralize the work, collaboration, and involvement of the extended community.

OuroborosCapital

Proposal Summary

This FIP proposes for the protocol to initiate a $1mn TWAMM over 30 days when price is below $5 and stopped (even when the TWAMM is midway) when price is above $5 and a $1mn TWAMM over 30 days when price is below $4 and stopped (even when the TWAMM is midway) when price is above $4.

If and when the $2mn budgeted for this proposal is exhausted, we will re-evaluate its effectiveness to make a decision on whether to recalibrate (increase and decrease) a new TWAMM.

The objective of this proposal is to optimize

FIP-77 for better efficiency in achieving POL value accretion. Details below.

Introduction

This is Ouroboros Capital. We are a liquid crypto fund that prides ourselves as vocal hands-on investors of our bags (FXS included).

The protocol has recently resumed its TWAMM FXS Buyback program again, kicking it off with a $2mn buyback over 6 months. I’m writing this proposal for us to consider parameters to which we can optimize for to design a much better buyback program.

Objective of Buyback

To start, we have to first understand what the buybacks are attempting to achieve. To put it simply, the buyback program’s objective is for the protocol to accumulate $FXS at prices which it deems $FXS to be undervalued. This delivers a spectrum of benefits including but not limited to 1) POL value accretion, 2) signaling a valuation floor to the market which consequently helps the protocol with more economic use of $FXS as incentives, 3) warehousing $FXS at cheap prices to be used in the future as it grows it value, etc.

Optimize for Acquiring $FXS at Low Prices

Now that we’ve established that the objective of the buybacks are to buy $FXS cheap and signal a psychological price floor to market, I would like to propose parameters which would help optimize for that.

I am proposing for a more aggressive TWAMM that increases in magnitude at lower levels but also stop buying $FXS at a higher levels.

What is The Right Size and Price?

Historically the TWAMM buyback have been the most effective at establishing a price floor between the $4-5 level. A level that we should also agree is only more of a value floor as time passes given the growth of the protocol Frax v1 to Frax v2 AMO, Fraxlend, FraxFerry, FrxETH, etc. As such I recommend the program to target these price levels given the historical context.

However, it is evident that these price levels are not visited for long. Since the introduction of the TWAMM buyback program last year, the price range of $4-5 has only been visited for 74 days. A mere ~20% of the days in the year. We will not be able to efficiently capture the value that presents itself if the TWAMM is spread across a period such as 6 months. Instead, I propose a $1mn TWAMM that spans over 1-month (30 days), buying only when price is below $5 and an additional $1mn 1-month TWAMM on top of it that starts buying only when price is below $4. We are proposing a 30-day period given it covers the lengths of time that has previously dipped the $5 level. See image and appendix below. The upper price limits circumvents the protocol chasing FXS higher and stops once the original objective of establishing a price floor has been achieved.

This more aggressive buyback would 1) create a stronger signaling to the market and 2) allow the protocol to more promptly capture these rare value windows.

Digesting Existing Sell Flow

It is worth highlighting too that the Uniswap and FraxSwap pools have seen an increase in ~74K $FXS since 5 days ago when price dipped below $5. Assuming $5 FXS, this is ~$370K of FXS sold in 5 days (~$2.2mn in 30 days) which the above proposed $2mn TWAMM should be able digest.

I welcome any suggestions and hope as a community we can work towards designing a better buyback program.

Summary:

This proposal seeks to set a 50% fee for all sunset pairs on Fraxlend as a measure to optimize the platform's performance and safeguard the interests of its users.

Background & Motivation:

Fraxlend, as a vital part of the Frax Finance ecosystem, is under continual evaluation and optimization to ensure the best performance and value for its users.

In Fraxlend, sunset pairs are defined as lending pairs that exhibit inefficient interest rate formulations, operate on older protocol versions, or have inefficient settings in their term sheet parameters. These factors contribute to suboptimal lending conditions, potentially exposing the protocol and/or its users to higher risk levels.

The present proposal suggests the introduction of a 50% fee on all sunset pairs. And the rationale behind this is to further reduce the economic appeal of these pairs and redirect users towards more active and efficient lending pairs.

Summary

Amend the Frax Ecosystem Educational Incentives and extend the program through the end of the year.

Background

FRAXBP dashboard that was submitted to the program.

Thread addressing frxETH critiques that was submitted

Intermediate article regarding the Frax ecosystem

The Frax Ecosystem Education Program has been quite successful the past two months in rallying researchers, writers, and dashboard creators in proliferating content about the protocol. After observing submissions and the evolving needs of the type of awareness that we want to prioritize, we would like to make several changes.

Proposal Details

We propose to make the following amendments:

Last month, we saw the monthly allocation surpass its limit of $10k to $12.25k. We used $2.25k from Month 3 to pay Month 2 participants fully. This will leave $7.75k allocated for Month 3. To address this issue, we propose implementing a dynamic reward system, capped by a reward table. However, in instances where the monthly budget is surpassed, the rewards will be reduced proportionally to the exceedance ratio. This ensures that each month's budget remains within the allocated limit.

Extend the program for another 6 months starting after the end of Month 3, July 12th, with allocation of $12k per month.

In the past two months, we've observed a high level of participation in the written category, a decent level of engagement in the thread category, and a lower participation rate in the video category. Given this trend, we propose to re-balance the reward structure.

Decrease rewards for both written article categories from $250 to $100

Decrease rewards for Twitter thread categories from $250 to $200 and $500 to $400

Decrease infographic rewards from $250 to $150 and $500 to $300

Change the video category from being “reach 10,000 views on a video” to “create tutorial video about anything Frax related” and have the reward be $250. The video category of reaching 1,000 views on a video remains the same.

Over the past two months, we have seen decent participation in dashboard creation. However, we have also observed instances of duplicated efforts and submissions of dashboards that do not provide substantial value. To enhance the efficiency and quality of submissions in this category, we propose introducing a pre-approval step for ideas before their application. This means that before embarking on the creation of a dashboard, participants will first submit their ideas for approval.

Proposal to add the rETH/frxETH(StaFi protocol) to the FXS gauge controller.

Background And Motivation

Building on the momentum of [

FIP - 229 ], which extended FXS gauge eligibility to pools and vaults with frxETH, we now have an opportunity to stimulate further growth of frxETH.

StaFi is already full supporting on the ideals that frax team wanted to achieve. We already proposed this few months ago with

FIP-220 but is not yet the right moment at that time. Now along with the latest proposal which is

Add the future FRAX/ETH pool on Swaap v2 to FXS gauge controller

The proposal will provide FRAX with the following benefits:

Reinforce FRAX as a “connector token” within DeFi

Improve FRAX-ETH execution by creating a direct liquidity venue (lower gas, lower spread)

Deepen liquidity on FRAX

Create a new yield opportunity for FRAX holders

Background about the protocol

Swaap v2 is a non-custodial RfQ market-making infrastructure offering optimal liquidity services, launching soon.

Market making in crypto is split between centralized & opaque actors & transparent AMMs that yield negative returns for their LPs. Swaap v2 brings the best of both worlds - profitable, open, transparent, non-custodial, composable, secure, & adaptive.

Swaap v1, launched in June 2022 on Polygon, proved that profitable onchain market making was possible. Its WBTC / WETH / USDC pool underwent less than 0.1% in Impermanent Loss.

Swaap v2 is set to further improve this by making the best market making models available onchain, focused on higher yield strategies. It also introduces new security standards in DeFi such as the onchain max-drawdown.

For further information, please refer to Swaap v2 whitepaper .

Why it’s good for FRAX

Increase demand & liquidity for FRAX in a transparent and sustainable way:

Launching a FRAX-ETH pair on Swaap v2 would improve FRAX-ETH execution by creating a direct liquidity venue. Today, a FRAX to ETH swap usually goes through Curve FRAX <> USDC and then Uniswap v3 USDC <> ETH. This represents an increased cost in terms of execution (spread) and gas fees. Having a direct pool on Swaap v2 would reduce such costs (notably on the gas fees side)

This improved execution would not need to be incentivized as much as it would be the case on an AMM like Uniswap v3 to compensate the Impermanent Loss as the pools are built to be profitable for LPs.

The liquidity would be deepened on FRAX in case of extreme events

Creating this direct route FRAX <> ETH would reinforce FRAX as a “connector token” within DeFi, and potentially attract volume from other DAO tokens which could pair their assets against FRAX.

As Swaap v2 pools are built to be profitable, this is an opportunity to create a new yield opportunity for FRAX holders. Besides, as ERC-20 tokens, Swaap v2 LP positions are highly composable and can appeal to a wide range of profiles once integrated into structured products.

Background and Motivation

This pool needs incentivization because the DeFi ecosystem would greatly benefit from increased diversity of fiat-backed stablecoin options. There are effectively only three viable options: USDC, USDT, and USDP. Two out of the three are under the jurisdiction of the US, which poses real systematic risks in the current regulatory environment. Though ZUSD is incredibly thorough with its regulatory policy (with permits and licenses to operate and serve US customers), GMO Trust is firmly part of a Japanese company.

ZUSD is a fiat-backed stablecoin with 1:1 redeemability with a total supply of 16,132,265.

ZUSD is currently tradeable on these decentralized exchanges: Uniswap and Curve pools.

ZUSD engages market makers and trading desks such as Hudson River Trading, GSR, Keyrock, JST Digital, and Profluent.

GMO Trust Company is a subsidiary of GMO Internet Group, an Internet service industry leader, developing and operating Japan’s most widely used domain, hosting & cloud, e-commerce, security, and payment solutions. The Group also includes the world’s largest online FX trading platform, as well as online advertising, Internet media, and cryptocurrency-related services. GMO Internet Group, Inc. (TSE: 9449) is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan.

GMO Trust Company connects traditional finance and blockchain for everyone. We are issuing GYEN, the world’s first regulated Japanese YEN-pegged stablecoin, and ZUSD, the new digital dollar. Established in 2020,

Summary

Add axlUSDC-FRAXBP Curve pool on Arbitrum to the FXS gauge controller.

Match $5k per month worth of bribes towards this pool 1:1 with Axelar Foundation voting through four voting cycles (~2 months).

Axelar to fully support axlUSDC and Frax through the full product suite.

Assess success over time and potentially extend this relationship to include further incentives per user demand and extend support to FPI and FXS.

Background and Motivation

Axelar delivers secure cross-chain communication for Web3. Our infrastructure enables dApp users to interact with any asset or application, on any chain, with one click. Axelar goes far beyond sending wrapped assets with General Message Passing, which carries any payload securely cross-chain. Applications can call any function on any connected chain and deliver a one-click experience for users on any other connected chain. This is a new kind of dApp development that puts users first and lets developers build on the platform best suited to their use case. axlUSDC is Axelar’s bridged version of Ethereum USDC, for every axlUSDC, there is one USDC locked on Ethereum. axlUSDC functions as Axelar’s routing asset across the 30 chains supported by the Axelar Network. This axlUSDC<>USDC pool will power hundreds of cross-chain applications built on Axelar’s decentralized cross-chain infrastructure, including native-to-native cross-chain swaps.

Axelar has seeded the initial liquidity for the axlUSDC<>FRAXBP pool on Arbitrum and would like to grow the volume and TVL of this pool through the additional incentives offered via bribes. The Frax team has offered to contribute to the bribes of this pool. We envisage this to be an attractive offering given the fact that axlUSDC pools are already earning at the time of writing between 10-20% natively on other chains. axlUSDC pools on Avalanche and Polygon are consistently one of the pools with the highest volumes in the last 6 months.

Section 0: Pool Deployment

The Frax team will aid Axelar to ensure that the prospective axlUSDC<>FRAXBP pool can be deployed properly across the full CRV/CVX/FXS gauge system, including proposal authorship and utilization of voting weight.

Section 1: Incentive Matching Budget

The Frax team will match $5k per month worth of bribes towards this pool 1:1 with Axelar Foundation voting through four voting cycles (~2 months).

All bribes will go towards incentivizing the axlUSDC-FRAXBP pool on Arbitrum.

This matching program will commence on the first voting cycle that sees axlUSDC-FRAXBP properly integrated into Curve/Convex/Frax gauges.

Section 2: Frax integration throughout Axelar

Currently, FRAX is supported on Axelar and Squid Router

Summary

Prioritize FRAX throughout the Axelar ecosystem, giving the users the opportunity to easily transfer assets across chains. By establishing this partnership, FRAX, and Axelar aim to foster liquidity provision, cross-chain interoperability, and the overall growth of the FRAX ecosystem. Together, we can create a more connected and efficient DeFi landscape, benefiting users, LPs, and the broader cryptocurrency community.

Frax to match $5,000 worth of monthly bribes with Axelar for four voting cycles.

Frax ecosystem participants benefit in a number of ways:

New yield farming opportunities on axlUSDC + FRAX

Increased demand and potential supply expansion on FRAX, driving greater revenue back to Frax holders

Routing of Frax assets throughout the broader DeFi ecosystem, driving relevant metrics like liquidity, borrow activity, trading volume, and so on

Authors f(x) Core Team

Summary

Allocate 60000 $vlCVX votes for fETH/FRAXBP for 6 months. In exchange, f(x) will offer Frax 4,000 FX tokens (0.2% of supply) vested linearly over 12 months from the first vote

Background f(x) Protocol creates two ETH derivative assets, one with stablecoin-like low volatility and the second a leveraged long ETH perpetual token.  These tokens are created by separating pure ETH collateral into a lower-volatility component (beta<1) called fractional ETH (fETH) and a higher-volatility (beta>1) one called leveraged ETH (xETH).  By constraining beta=0.1 the fractional ETH token captures some growth of the cryptocurrency market while limiting volatility enough to retain the characteristics of a stablecoin. The leveraged ETH component is essentially a long perpetual future contract with zero funding costs and variable leverage. With only pure ETH collateral the system is not exposed to centralized risk.  Maximum liquidity of fETH can scale quickly compared with CDP-issued stablecoins because it is based on the high demand for leveraged long ETH positions (xETH) rather than the relatively lower demand for CDPs, with their attendant maintenance and capital inefficiency.

More details can be found in f(x) white paper . f(x) Tokenomics

FX is f(x)’s native token and it uses Curve’s ve- tokenomic system, with lockers sharing platform revenue and progressively increasing governance power. f(x) charges fees to minting and redeeming of fETH/xETH tokens and at least 50% of which will be distributed to veFX holders. This makes liquidity mining (or bribe payments) more sustainable than simple inflation because FX is a proxy for real, ongoing platform revenue. Locking FX is marketed as a set-and-forget way to earn ETH over time.

More details can be found in f(x) tokenomics article .

Motivation

Increasing liquidity and visibility for the fETH/FRAXBP pool will be extremely helpful to the operation of f(x). It would also be beneficial and additive to f(x) and Frax ecosystem in the following ways: f(x) provides unique new farming opportunities for Aladdin and Frax communities; fETH gets good liquidity support and it expands utility for FRAX as well. This creates a strong win-win situation for both the f(x) and Frax ecosystem.

Proposal

In order to create a deeper pool and to attract liquidity which will support fETH/FRAXBP, we propose that Frax vote with 60,000 vlCVX for the fETH/FRAXBP pool for 6 months on Votium. In exchange, f(x) will offer Frax 4,000 FX tokens (0.2% of supply) vested over 12 months from the first vote.

[FIP - 239] FRAX <> Convergence - Seed investment proposal,[FIP - 239] FRAX <> Convergence - Seed investment proposal,"Jun 9, 2023 · 9:28 AM","Jun 9, 2023 · 9:28 AM","Jun 14, 2023 · 9:28 AM","Dear Frax community,

We would like to propose a seed investment to the DAO, as our intent as a protocol is to be deeply involved within the Curve/Frax ecosystem.

I. Introduction to the Convergence protocol

Before jumping into the proposal (or the docs), we kindly suggest reading this article that breaks down the entire protocol: https://medium.com/cvgfinance/convergers-to-the-void-12e2b4e4cbde

Convergence is an agnostic “Convex-like” layer, that aims to be deployed on top of various protocols, starting with Tokemak. In addition to the well-known “Convex-like” behavior of aggregation/optimization of underlying protocols, Convergence also gathers mechanisms inspired from Curve, and Olympus. Gauges and veTokenomics will be used to drive emissions, and a

Bonding Program has been established. Using bonds to build Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) and a diversified treasury will allow Convergence to ensure self-sustainalibity, but also to reward token holders with an intrinsic incentive mechanism that does not rely on underlying protocols’ aggregation.

Overall, Convergence will:

Aggregates protocols and operate metagovernance (governance of underlying protocols) like Convex;

Operates its own governance and direct emissions like Curve;

Issues discounted CVG through bonds like Olympus;

Deploys the treasury and rewards CVG lockers.

Below is a brief breakdown of the 3 primary pillars of Convergence.

Aggregations:

Starting with Tokemak ( https://twitter.com/TokenReactor)Documentation : https://docs.cvg.finance/staking/convergence-for-tokemak

Each staking contract will be paired to a gauge and will be able to receive CVG emissions. Staking positions are tokenized. The governance power held by Convergence over Tokemak is delegated to CVG lockers (via mgCVG). Metagovernance will be operated on Snapshot.

For TOKE stakers: deposit and convert TOKE to cvgTOKE. Underlying TOKE are split between regular TOKE staking and TOKE locking (accTOKE). TOKE and wETH rewards are distributed to cvgTOKE stakers (with CVG on top according to the cvgTOKE gauge weight). Convergence will deploy and manage a cvgTOKE/TOKE stable pool on Curve. Various peg-defense mechanisms are planned.

For Liquidity Providers: staking of tAssets (Tokemak’s LP). All tAssets are then socialized in a

Black Hole that claims all TOKE rewards in one go once a week. Tokemak’s native TOKE distribution is then overwritten, and TOKE rewards are distributed back to tAssets stakers according to each tAsset relative gauge weight. CVG will be added on top of TOKE rewards, according to gauge weights.

Bonds & Treasury:

Documentation (bonds): https://docs.cvg.finance/bonds-and-treasury/bonds

Documentation (treasury): https://docs.cvg.finance/bonds-and-treasury/treasury

We use a 100% homemade bond technology. It relies on a custom and generic on-chain Oracle paired to Chainlink price feeds, that doesn’t allow negative ROI by design. Bonds will be used to acquire stablecoins (FRAX and crvUSD) and Curve ecosystem assets (CRV, CVX, FXS, FPIS, CNC, SDT, TOKE etc). The treasury will then be deployed in the Curve ecosystem on various protocols, and rewards will be harvested at least every 2 weeks. Every 3 months, 80% of these rewards will be distributed to CVG lockers as a real yield, paid in CRV, CVX, CNC, FXS and SDT (FPIS can be added to the cohort). A zap function will be available. Bonding positions, like staking positions, are tokenized.

Locking mechanism (

Govearn ):

Documentation: https://docs.cvg.finance/cvg-token/cvg-locking

CVG lockers govern the protocol, direct emissions, operate metagovernance, and earn 80% of the yield generated by the working treasury. CVG can be locked up for a maximum of 96 weeks (almost 2 years). Locking positions are tokenized as an NFT (ERC-721).

When CVG is locked, three locking primitives can be created: veCVG : forked from veCRV, used for gauge votes and governance ( https://docs.cvg.finance/cvg-token/cvg-locking/understanding-vecvg ): mgCVG : stands for metagovernance

CVG, comparable to vlCVX, used for Snapshot metagovernance votes ( https://docs.cvg.finance/cvg-token/cvg-locking/understanding-mgcvg ); ysCVG : stands for yield sharing

CVG, represents a claiming right on treasury profits distributed every three months ( https://docs.cvg.finance/cvg-token/cvg-locking/understanding-yscvg ).

When a user creates a locked position, he can choose to lock CVG for veCVG and/or ysCVG. The percentage of CVG that will be allocated to compute both amounts can be customized for every position (50/50, 80/20, 0/100, 100/0…). Locking to veCVG will generate mgCVG. Locking to ysCVG only won’t generate any mgCVG. In other terms, users who lock CVG will have to arbitrate between governance and profit sharing, governance being represented by veCVG/mgCVG, and profit sharing by ysCVG. Delegation has been established for each primitive .

Tokenomics: https://docs.cvg.finance/cvg-token/tokenomics

Diagram of the financial flows: https://docs.cvg.finance/general-information/protocol-overview/financial-flows-basics

II. Interactions and direct synergies with Frax

Airdrop:

Every protocol holding TOKE will be airdroped, proportionally to its TOKE holding. Therefore, Frax will be receiving the highest allocation among DAOs holding TOKE.

DAOs allocations will be distributed at launch, in the form of full governance locked positions (100% veCVG/mgCVG), to incentivize governance participation.

Frax protocol participants will also be able to claim an individual airdrop after launch (TBD).

Staking: tFRAX and tFXS holders will be able to stake their tAsset within Convergence, to earn CVG in addition to TOKE.

And easy-to-go UX will allow direct deposits of FRAX and FXS on Convergence, instead of tFRAX and tFXS.

Emission direction: veCVG holders will be able to direct both TOKE and CVG emissions to the tFRAX and tFXS staking contracts. The fact that Convergence overwrites native TOKE rewards will allow TOKE emission to be directed through gauge votes, which is not possible natively on Tokemak.

Bond offering:

Users will be able to buy CVG at a discount against FRAX and FXS.

Treasury rewards: ysCVG holders will be able to receive FXS (and potentially FPIS) as rewards earned from treasury deployments.

Metagovernance and rewards:

By holding locked positions, Frax may be able to: direct CVG emission to staking contracts; hold governance power over multiple protocols; earn CRV, CVX and CNC, extending Frax influence over the Curve ecosystem.

Fundraising:

We are raising on-chain, and we accept DAI and FRAX only (contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x06feb7a047e540b8d92620a2c13ec96e1ff5e19b ).

In the future:

After Tokemak, we have 3 additional aggregations planned. The work for the 2nd one is already in progress, and the code should be done within a month. These 3 aggregations target protocols that are heavily involved within the Curve ecosystem. Once all 4 aggregations will be done, the DAO will vote to choose which protocol should be integrated next.

Each aggregation will have direct interactions with Frax. The 2nd aggregation will allow Frax users to stake liquid derivatives of veFXS and veFPIS, while enjoying boosted bribe yield, in addition to CVG incentives on top. It will also be possible to stake Curve LPs, such as frxETH/ETH or FRAX/USDC, to earn boosted yield, and still, CVG incentives on top.

It is also possible to imagine a direct Frax integration within Convergence, built on a different model than those made by Convex and Stake DAO. Such an aggregation would require sufficient voting power on Curve, to be properly bootstrapped.

Overall, our goal is to create a symbiotic relationship between Frax and Convergence, that would be similar to the one between Frax and Convex.

III. Security

Testing process:

Prior to audit, we conducted an extensive testing program, using our own private testnet. In a few words, we forked the mainnet and we deployed an Etherscan-like solution on top called Ethernal. Then, we established test scenarios, that we played directly on the frontend. The purpose of this testing process was mostly to ensure that the logic was right, and that the code was behaving as expected.

More infos in this article: https://medium.com/cvgfinance/testing-sagittarius-0x-7b9265dc66d6 .

Audit:

The code is being audited by Halborn ( https://twitter.com/HalbornSecurity ) since the 24th of April. According to them, the audit should be finished by the 9 of June. So far, they didn’t identify any critical issue.

Audit competition:

Once the audit with Halborn will be fully finished (a few return trips are possible to correct potential problems after reporting), we will launch an audit competition on

Hats.Finance ( https://app.hats.finance/vaults ).

IV. Terms

Seed FDV: $19.5M

Vesting: 120 days cliff, 5% released post cliff, followed by a 15 months linear vesting, with releases every 45 days.

We are proposing a $100,000 investment, made with FRAX. It would represent 769,230 CVG (0,51% of the total supply).

Most notable investors:

Kaizen DAO ( https://twitter.com/kaizen_dao ), NGC Ventures ( https://twitter.com/NGC_Ventures ), Prismatic Capital ( https://twitter.com/PrismaticCap ), Blockhub DAO ( https://twitter.com/BlockhubDao ), deWhales Capital ( https://twitter.com/DewhalesCapital ), MrBlock ( @mrblocktw ) and a core team member of Curvance ( https://twitter.com/Curvance ).

Summary

IntoTheBlock (ITB) is requesting a grant to build the following set of risk management solutions for Frax Lend and its community:

An open dashboard monitoring general and pool-specific risk indicators

CSV downloads of underlying data for all indicators

API access for core contributors to access data

Documentation covering Frax Lend’s risk dynamics

The dashboard would be hosted on ITB’s risk radar product (currently the Alpha phase is available here ) and also as a section within the

FraxFacts site . Each indicator’s data would be openly available for Frax users to keep track of and mitigate economic risks. These metrics are particularly relevant to attract institutional investors and are based on ITB’s experience managing risks on nine figures for some of crypto’s largest balance sheets.

On a quarterly basis IntoTheBlock’s team would add support for more pools added to Frax Lend and update metrics accordingly.

Abstract

IntoTheBlock has been deeply involved in DeFi over the past two years. This began with the launch of DeFi Insights analytics and grew substantially through its institutional quantitative strategies (

ITB Quant ) service. ITB’s DeFi Quant Platform serves as the gateway used by over 20 of the largest crypto institutions to access DeFi yields via sophisticated quantitative strategies with corresponding risk management models.

To help streamline institutional adoption of DeFi, IntoTheBlock decided to enable access to its risk indicators and models via APIs and analytics dashboards. The objective of this proposal is to build these risk models and have them openly available for Frax Lend’s institutional and retail investors.

Motivation

Risk monitoring and management is paramount for any financial service. The recent events in the DeFi market have proven that risk management is essential to catalyze the growth of the space. At ITB we believe that risk management in DeFi should be done out in the open, following crypto’s ethos, and not be a luxury expense.

Following ITB’s experience safeguarding hundreds of millions into DeFi through advanced risk management models, we believe that expanding these tools and offering them to Frax Lend would help make DeFi safer over the mid- to long-term. Enabling real time economic risk monitoring for Frax Lend should be an important element to provide confidence to institutional and retail investors.

Specification & Implementation

IntoTheBlock is requesting $60,000 to build near real-time economic risk monitoring and analytics for the Frax Lend protocol. Specifically, the grant will cover the following deliverables:

Economic Risk API: REST API enabling access to dozens of economic risk indicators in the Frax Lend protocol.

Economic Risk Dashboard: Web interface that includes visualizations of the most important risk indicators.

Documentation: Complete documentation of all risk indicators included in the release.

These deliverables will be split into three main milestones, requesting $15k to be paid upon completion of each plus $15k upfront and a $15k annual maintenance fee.

Frax Lend ITB Grant Milestones & Payments:

Upfront payment ($15k)

Indicators 1-6 (dashboard + API) ($15k)

Indicators 7-11 (dashboard + API) ($15k)

Documentation covering Frax Lend’s risk dynamics and indicators ($15k)

This release will include the risk indicators outlined in this document for the 15 assets supported as collateral on the Frax Lend protocol at the time of writing. The following Figma mock-ups made by ITB’s design team demonstrates how the proposed layout would look like within the

ITB risk product and on the

Frax Facts platform . (Keep in mind that this does not yet include live data from protocol and is just for reference).

These indicators are subject to modification based on feedback from the community and Frax Lend’s team. The ITB team is committed to upgrading these indicators as Frax Lend expands and to incorporate the community’s feedback to make these risk tools more useful over time. For this ongoing maintenance, ITB requests an additional $15k fee annually.

Conclusion

IntoTheBlock’s proposal looks to enable real time economic risk monitoring for the Frax Lend protocol. The risk indicators included in this proposal are based on IntoTheBlock’s experience managing and monitoring risk for Frax Lend and similar protocols. The initial release is an attempt to democratize access to sophisticated risk models for all investors participating in the Frax Lend protocol.

TBD

10,000,000 FRAX

Background and Motivation

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Any token part of a Chainlink data feed can be lent to borrowers or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt. rETH is the most decentralized LSD on the market and is second in supply only to stETH. By adding it to Fraxlend we can enable the minting and backing of even more FRAX.

Proposal

Create a FXS gauge for a Convex crvUSD/Frax LP position. https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crvusd-4

The staking token is a wrapped Convex staking position represented by an erc-20 that receives CRV and CVX rewards. This token can then be staked on a Frax Finance gauge to then also receive FXS rewards.

The wrapped staking position itself is an unmanaged trustless position and can be found on the Convex github at https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapperFrax.sol

Note that a previous FIP(110) passed for the addition of a crvUSD/FraxBP FXS gauge. The team decided a direct crvUSD pairing would be better suited for this particular pool.

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO on layer two chains is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Summary

This proposal aims to authorize a maximum annual budget of

9,000,000 FRAX for Frax Finance. This budget is intended to cover five key categories: development and operation, Security, Grant, Reserve Emergency Fund, and Legal & Compliance. Please note that this is a maximum cap, and it is highly likely that not all of it will be used.

Background and motivation

At this stage in Frax Finance's growth trajectory, the destructive impact of capital limitations cannot be overstated. We focus on stimulating growth, driving innovation, and addressing potential legal and security challenges. The proposed maximum annual budget reflects these priorities, having been informed by carefully analyzing our past financial strategies and those of other successful protocols. Our goal is to create a robust financial system that allows us to respond to changes swiftly, seize opportunities, and ensure the continued growth and resilience of our protocol.

Details

Budget Categories

Development and Operation:

This budget will be used to cover the costs associated with the development and operation of the Frax Finance protocol. This could include salaries for developers, costs of new feature development, maintenance costs, infrastructure costs, and other operational expenses.

Security (Audits and Bug Bounty):

This budget is allocated to maintaining the security of the Frax Finance protocol. This includes the costs of regular security audits by external firms, running a bug bounty program to incentivize the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities and other measures to ensure the safety and trust of our community.

Grants:

This budget will fund grants for projects or initiatives that contribute to the Frax Finance ecosystem. This could include funding for independent developers or teams building on Frax, research initiatives, educational content, community events, and more (e.g.,

Frax Ecosystem Educational Incentives ).

Reserve Emergency Fund:

This budget is a financial safety net for unforeseen circumstances. It can respond to unexpected events, such as sudden market changes, emergency protocol upgrades, or other contingencies that require immediate financial resources.

Legal and Compliance:

This budget covers legal and compliance costs to ensure that Frax Finance operates within the legal framework. This could include fees for legal counsel, regulatory compliance costs, potential legal disputes, and other related expenses.

Additional Notes

This proposal represents the maximum caps for each category, not necessarily the exact amounts that will be used.

This proposal does not cover the costs of liquidity incentivization. Kindly refer to the

Votium and

WETHR proposals for budget allocations related to liquidity incentivization.

All previously approved budgets are still in effect and considered in our ongoing operations. This proposal is designed to supplement and build upon the existing financial strategies.

This proposal does not account for FXS. The team plans to continue utilizing their current treasury allotment of FXS for core development compensation. If more FXS resources become necessary in the future, a specific governance proposal will be initiated.

Summary

This proposal seeks to expand the eligibility criteria for the FXS Gauge within the Frax DAO system. We propose to include pools or vaults with frxETH as their underlying token alongside those already eligible with FRAX.

Background and motivation

The FXS Gauge mechanism, designed to incentivize locked liquidity, has until now been primarily limited to pools or vaults deploying FRAX as their underlying asset. Including the frxETH-ETH pair was a notable exception, marking one of the first occasions where a non-FRAX stablecoin pair was whitelisted. This proposal aims to extend the eligibility to other frxETH pairs, in response to the Frax community's feedback and to further enhance the functionality and adaptability of the Frax ecosystem.

After careful consideration, we believe that frxETH, just like FRAX, plays a crucial role in our ecosystem and should be equally eligible for gauge incentives. Additionally, veFXS holders can decide where they see the best value, providing a democratic solution to any potential distribution concerns.

Details

Upon approval of this proposal, pools or vaults with frxETH as their underlying token would be eligible for the FXS Gauge system. We believe this is a step forward in our ecosystem, offering more options and flexibility to our community. The team is fully aware of the potential challenges it may bring, and we commit to closely monitoring the situation and making necessary adjustments when and if they become necessary.

Motivation:

The evolution towards FRAX v3 signifies a pivotal phase in our journey, marking a new era of autonomy and decentralization for the Frax protocol. As we transition away from dependency on one fiat currency, our commitment to creating a more resilient, secure, and innovative FRAX is unwavering.

Central to this transformation is the inclusion of the FRAX/USDP liquidity pool. USDP, a regulated digital dollar backed one-to-one by US dollars, offers stability and trust, making it an ideal partner for this venture. Implementing a gauge for this pool aligns with our strategic objectives to stimulate liquidity, encourage participation, and enhance trading conditions, all while increasing our treasury bill revenue.

Author(s): 0xBroze + Anthias Team (0xBroze#1326 in Frax Discord)

Submission Date: April 30, 2023

Proposal Overview

Simple Summary

The Anthias team is proposing a grant to build a Fraxlend-specific liquidation health dashboard for the Fraxlend borrowing and lending market. This analytics dashboard will exist for the Fraxlend community, enabling stakeholders within the Fraxlend borrowing & lending ecosystem to manage liquidation cascade risk and more.

About Anthias + Abstract

The Anthias team is composed of three members of Dartmouth Blockchain. Our philosophy is to continually provide value to the blockchain ecosystem through shipping useful products and research. We have extensive experience in DeFi, having contributed at Yeti Finance, Primitive Finance, Temple DAO, and more. We have shipped multiple grants for

Euler and

Aave and have recently been approved for integrations with Compound V2 and V3 as well as Exactly Protocol.

This liquidation dashboard will improve the Fraxlend stakeholder/token holder experience by allowing users to identify wallets close to liquidation on Fraxlend and position themselves accordingly. The recent crash of May 2022 was caused largely by a series of liquidation cascades as large whale wallets were liquidated. As liquidators sold massive amounts of collateral on exchanges, collateral prices dropped, which resulted in more liquidations. We created Anthias to democratize liquidation health data of all wallets, so all users are able to manage liquidation risk more effectively.

Previous Work Showcase / Who Supports Anthias?

Aave

We created our initial dashboard in June of 2022 to monitor liquidation health on Aave after the Terra/Luna collapse.

We completed our first grant for Aave in October of 2022. In this grant, we expanded our initial Aave dashboard to allow users to view historical liquidation health data in order to develop an even clearer picture around market risk.

Euler

We completed our first grant for Euler in September of 2022. This grant was to integrate our initial liquidation health dashboard with Euler.

Our second Euler grant was completed in January of 2023. With this grant, we expanded our tool suite for Euler to do Value at Risk monitoring and simulations, in-depth asset and health score filtering, and a more granular wallet view to show covariance among assets individual users were borrowing and supplying.

Compound

We were approved for our first integration with Compound V2 and V3 in March of 2023. This grant is to integrate our initial liquidation health dashboard with both Compound V2 and V3.

Exactly

We were approved for our first integration with Exactly Protocol in February of 2023. This grant is to integrate our initial liquidation health dashboard with Exactly on both Ethereum and Optimism.

Motivation

There are a number of risk vectors in borrowing and lending protocols, including smart contract risk, price oracle manipulation risk, governance / pool management risk, and market risk (liquidations + bad debt). As protocols like Fraxlend continue to onboard more users, it is increasingly important to equip users with necessary risk-management analytics for healthy activity. Safeguarding users against risk ensures the long-term sustainability of the protocol, as well as an improved user experience (competitive differentiation with other borrowing and lending protocols).

Projects like Gauntlet Network and RiskDAO have showcased what is possible with on-chain analytics for DeFi. On a longer term horizon, we hope to expand on previous projects in two ways: historical data and granular daily data. We will store various metrics (some already live at Anthias.xyz), including Aggregate Liquidation Health, Total Collateral Value at Risk, Wallets at Risk, and more. Users will be able to monitor the historical trends of these metrics, while also viewing granular breakdowns of these metrics per day. We see Anthias as a useful public good for various stakeholders within the Fraxlend ecosystem to manage risk: the DAO governors, users (borrowers and lenders), and researchers. The Anthias team prides itself on making risk management tools usable by all stakeholders–we will continue that mission via these tools for the Fraxlend community.

Specification & Implementation

We are proposing a grant to fund the development of integrating a Fraxlend dashboard with Anthias.xyz for the Fraxlend borrowing and lending market with the deliverables listed below:

Live metrics presented: Active Wallets, Wallets at Risk, and Aggregate Liquidation Score

Table view presented: Active Wallets (includes address, supply amount, borrow amount, and liquidation health)

Graph view presented: Active wallets (includes liquidation health and wallet size visualization)

The ability for users to download a CSV of the data presented in the Table View, so that data can be used in modeling

Wallet View that displays collateral and debt by asset for individual wallets

Cost

The cost of this integration for our team will be $17k upon completion of the dashboard. This payment will be used for the following costs:

Database storage ($500)

Server hosting ($50)

Nodes ($450)

Contributor compensation ($16,000)

The deliverables will be live at www.anthias.xyz/Fraxlend . These dashboards will be live for 6 months at which point the community can determine whether it would like to fund the Anthias team on a per-quarter basis to maintain server costs.

Timeline // How long will development take?

We estimate development time to take 6-7 weeks from approval. Based on feedback from community members, we plan to continue iterating and shipping out new and useful features.

Spiral DAO is a novel DAO model that aims to accumulate a significant share in CRV, BAL, FXS, and other DeFi blue chips through Yield Bonding. The Yield Bonding mechanism allows users to deposit yield-earning assets and receive COIL instead of their underlying rewards, which are then deposited into yield-earning strategies in our treasury. COIL absorbs the sell pressure that CRV/CVX/FXS would typically face, as 100% of the yields earned are locked in non-predatory strategies managed by the Spiral DAO team.

Motivation:

Spiral DAO supports Frax stability and deployed a majority of LP paired with FraxBP.

Spiral DAO decrease overall sell pressure for FXS / CRV / CVX emissions by utilizing them in non-cannibalistic ways. Spiral DAO plans to support FraxSwap pools for yield bonding in the roadmap and looking to increase its exposure towards FXS.

Spiral DAO plans to participate and buy votes on bribe markets with USDC, thus increasing the overall yield to veFXS voters.

Spiral DAO currently owns about

37.8k locked CRV , or about 300k USD at current prices; see

Treasury Multisig and looking to increase it's exposure.

For: Add the COIL/FraxBP pool to the FXS gauge controller

Proposal

The statement has been made “if you want an unlock, refund all the rewards.”

Below, you will find math showing proportionate calculations outlining how many rewards the current and proposed-to-be-unlocked-TVL received.

Additionally, you will find the grand total of all rewards ever given.

The “Respective Percentage” or “RP” was calculated by comparing the (current) proposed-to-be-unlocked-TVL weight against the TVL of any 1 voting period, since inception of the pool’s gauge.

If the Frax Gatekeepers feel the proposed amount is unreasonable given the data shown in this iteration of the proposal, then I will leave it up to them to decide what they believe is fair, just please make the proper adjustment in the snapshot version of the vote.

I encourage any interested party to run the numbers themselves to verify I did not error, and to voice their opinion, especially if in opposition.

EDIT#1

Per the recommendation of Sir Sam Kazemian, I have edited the figures to include the average(AVG.) price of FXS at the time of rewards-emitted for all voting periods to date. The AVG is calculated using 3 data points: First-Voting-Date, Last-Voting-Date/First-APR-date and Last-APR-Date. Using the AVG price of FXS per period, I will then include both the total, and the weight-adjusted # as before.

EDIT#2

After further discussion with Sam K (thank you sir), It was pointed out that I made one grave error in my initial calculations; my original equations did not account for the Time-Lock Boost Multiplier of Emissions per capita. The calculations below now account for this.

Sam proposed a 3x across the board on all previous “Liable Debt” calculations, for simplicities sake. I ran into a problem while performing that operation however, in that once we get to more recent figures, the 3x results in an over calculation. To combat this, I decided to use a “Virtual Weight” for the figures, which allowed me to apply the 3x while still retaining the relative weight per pool, per period, to determine the value of rewards owed. The virtual weight calculations account for the 3x boost to APR through TVL rather than directly to APR, the same way the gauges do. This was a much more workable method of achieving the desired outcome of accounting for the 3x boost on locked TVL and how it affected rewards and thereby the Debt Liability in this proposal.

I started with a MAX LOCK(3.0x) and utilized a linear decay (-0.013 every 7 days) for the boost calculations. (Additionally, I found a single figure where I incorrectly calculated the average price of FXS for a single period and have since corrected that.)

Total $value$ upon emission of ALL rewards = $576,460.9796 = 23.2% (fee)

Total USD of all FXS rewards emitted to 2.484m LP valued at time of emission, using Max Boost of 3.0 with linear decay : $208,481.0176

208,481.0176 / 2,484,000 = 8.39%

I propose the 2.484m TVL within the StakeDAO sdETH-FraxPut Pool be unlocked for a withdrawal fee equal to the USD-Value-at-time-of-Emission of ALL FXS rewarded to the (2.484m) LP in this pool (8.39% of 2.484m TVL) (+ slippage ~1.57%) = 10% FEE

Vote

The 4626 Alliance has been funded by Mstable, Aztec, Balancer, and Superform with participation from various other DeFi protocols to further adoption of the ERC-4626 standard. We believe this standard is important for DeFi vault composability and security. It substantially lowers the integration effort for other protocols and increases the ability to leverage a variety of community tools for safe development.

Our goal is to make the vast majority of DeFi in the next year compatible with ERC-4626 and become a first-line resource for developers to build vaults going forward.

For more details on the initiative, view our:

4626 Alliance Website ( https://erc4626.info/ ) where you can find resources about ERC-4626, a description of the purpose of the Alliance and its supporters, a Bounty Board, a database of live ERC-4626 compliant vaults, and a news section.

Notion – The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases. ) that describes this initiative and proposes a series of actions to move the standard forward

Twitter: @erc4626 & public telegram group: erc4626alliance

Why join?

Contributing capital would additionally allow Frax to influence the decision making around the development of other relevant 4626s and integrate across all current and future product lines. This includes development efforts to make Frax’s own contracts conform with the standard for plugging into other DeFi protocols.

With staked frxETH already being one of the first widely used ERC-4626 implementations, Frax would also be able to contribute to the 4626 Alliance as a Starring Partner for the sponsorship of the creation of the open source resource library, establishment of the common pipeline of “4626 essentials,” and promotion of the 4626 standards through publication and events.

Estimated size & use of funds:

The Alliance has raised ~$40k in commitments. We are asking for a contribution of $3-5k from Frax to join these efforts. Existing funds are being used to create 4626 resources and built adapters for agreed upon DeFi protocols via bounty programs.

Summary

Authorize $57.5k worth of FXS towards Fraxbuild, the first ever official Frax hackathon hosted by Dorahacks and powered by Flywheel DeFi

Background

DoraHacks is a global hackathon organizer and one of the world's most active multi-chain Web3 developer communities. As a leader in the global hacker movement, Dora provides crypto-native toolkits to help developers around the world raise funding and build. To date, 30+ major blockchain ecosystems have already adopted Dora's infrastructure (hackerlink.io / dorafactory.org) for quadratic funding, community contribution, hackathon, bounty distribution, and governance of their developer communities. By far, 2200 projects in the DoraHacks community have received over $20 million in grants and contributions from supporters worldwide.

In over two years since launch, Frax has been able to establish themselves as one of the protocols teams in all of DeFi. Although the core team only counts in the single digits, they have been able to propagate an ecosystem of stablecoins and subprotocols. The question remains though, if we want Frax to reach the heights comparable to Ethereum and beyond, how can we cultivate a community to build on it?

Fraxbuild is the first official hackathon endorsed by Frax Finance. The event will be online and hackers will have 50 days to submit their applications. The goal of this hackathon is to increase dev awareness of building on Frax, promote the creation of products and primitives that complement the Frax ecosystem of stablecoins and primitives, as well as educate developers about how they can integrate Frax into their protocols.

Utilizing its platform, Flywheel DeFi will help organize and spread awareness about the event via

This is a proposal to onboard and activate an AMO that lends FRAX to Flux Finance. We propose a Max Allocation Cap for the AMO of 2MM FRAX to get the community comfortable with the workflows. Flux Finance is a decentralized lending protocol developed by Ondo Finance that enables over-collateralized lending and borrowing in a peer-to-pool model. The protocol is a fork of Compound V2 with minor modifications related to permissioning that have been audited through code4rena. Loans on Flux are overcollateralized by the Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG), a class of limited partnership interests in Ondo I LP, a Delaware limited partnership. OUSG is backed by investments in the Blackrock iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV) and uses third-party regulated service providers for custody, fund administration, and auditing. This proposal begins by providing an overview of Ondo entities and the structure of OUSG before turning to Flux and its FRAX Lending Pool.

Background:

Zunami Protocol is a DAO that aims to maximize returns on stablecoins and streamline interaction with DeFi by solving the main issues of current yield-farming protocols. The Zunami Protocol integrates directly with Curve/StakeDAO/Convex smart contracts by providing liquidity in pools. Zunami utilizes an Omni pool to rebalance and diversify user funds. The current set of strategies is approved by DAO vote and consists of XAI/FRAXBP, ALUSD/FRAXBP, and MIM/3CRV.

UZD is a stablecoin with a rebase mechanism that is collateralized by LP tokens of Zunami and backed by stablecoins held in Curve pools. UZD is also a pool-aware token that stops rebasing when it is inside a pool, while the rebase continues outside the pool. Furthermore, CRV, CVX, and FXS, which were initially intended for rebase, are now either locked or used for bribing.

Motivation:

Zunami supports the FRAX ecosystem, with over 50% of the protocol's funds allocated to FRAXBP pools. Recently, FRAX was also added as one of the main stablecoins for deposits and withdrawals, alongside USDT, USDC, and DAI. Additionally, the team plans to launch an ETH omni pool with frxETH as one of the main assets.

Unlock the StakeDAO sdETH-FraxPut Gauge

Background & Motivation

In a recent statement, StakeDAO announced that they are deprecating their options products: https://twitter.com/StakeDAOHQ/status/1635705988865982467

This closure is of relevance as one product, the ETH Put Selling Strategy, occupies a Frax gauge (sdETH-FraxPut) and has associated locked liquidity. StakeDAO users are currently being advised to withdraw from their options position. As such, this author believes the Frax community should vote to unlock the gauge.

The ETH Put Selling Strategy (the Strategy) is described on the StakeDAO website:

This strategy leverages Opyn’s oTokens to sell 7-day European ETH put options every Friday to market makers via Airswap. The premium received generates passive income for its users. The position is covered with USD stable coin collateral representing 100% of the face value of the put options sold. The USD stable coin collateral is staked into Stake DAO’s Passive FRAX Strategy to generate additional yield.

From the Frax perspective, having the position collateralized with FRAX3CRV pool tokens helps with the $FRAX peg. Some community members believe this is sufficient reason alone to reject unlocking (for example, see Dennett: https://gov.frax.finance/t/3crv-4pool-unlock-lps-in-the-sdeth-fraxput-and-sdfrax3crv-f-gauge-pools/1348/5 ), and I understand this perspective. Indeed, recent market conditions have illustrated the importance of maintaining a strong $FRAX peg. However, the fact remains that the strategy was designed, first and foremost, to sell ETH puts. Lockers had a reasonable expectation that ETH puts would continue to be sold while the gauge persists – this is no longer the case.

In terms of numbers:

Current gauge weight: 0.28% (~123 FXS per week)

Current value locked: 2.5 million USD

Finally, just a broad comment: The partnership between Frax and StakeDAO has been one of the more enjoyable to witness. It has been a pleasure to see how these two teams and communities have supported each other thus far, with supporting products on each platform and many dual community members. Perhaps optimistically, I hope that Frax members will extend this support once more to StakeDAO by unlocking the sdETH-FraxPut gauge, though I am sure the good vibes will continue regardless of the outcome.

Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Summary

Authorize a maximum of $10k per month (3 months) for KPI-based incentives for educational/marketing content related to the Frax ecosystem and have Flywheel manage submissions.

Background

In January 2023, under the suggestion of Frax core team member Nader, we removed incentives from our original grant proposal.

We believe now is the time for such a program to be put in place, not just for Flywheel but for all content creators in the Frax community. There is still much to be done in terms of educating the wider DeFi ecosystem and beyond about Frax, and proliferating quality content is a good starting point.

Proposal Details

We propose a maximum allocation of $30k for three months (max $10k per month) in educational/marketing content about the Frax ecosystem. Flywheel will receive a fee of 12.5% of the grants distributed in FXS for administering the program.

Categories of content include written, video, or infographic.

Suggestions of content include FRAX, frxETH, FRAXBP, FPI, Frax Primitives (Fraxlend, Fraxswap, Fraxferry), etc.

Submissions of content are to be managed by the Flywheel team based on quality and relevance to the Frax ecosystem.

Frax core team will have final approval of which content is rewarded or rejected.

Incentives will be paid in FXS

Incentives will be paid at the end of each month in a first-come, first-served manner. If the monthly paid incentives reached the cap, the rest of the queue would be considered for the next month.

Summary

Authorize matching FRAX from the FXS buyback fund with Frax's ARB airdrop  to create ARB-FRAX liquidity using funds set aside from FIP-77.

Background and Motivation

In June of last year,

Frax was appropriated $20m dollars in FIP-77 to use for FXS buybacks. Since being approved, approximately $2m FRAX has been used for this purpose.

On March 23, 2023, Frax received over 500,000 ARB from the Arbitrum Foundation as part of their airdrop. Frax can either use this ARB to take part in governance or it can be used to deepen liquidity on Curve, Fraxswap and Uniswap. Frax should be allowed to use part or all of the FXS buyback fund to create new protocol owned liquidity on Arbitrum using part or all of its ARB airdrop.

PROPOSAL

For:

Authorize matching FRAX from the FXS buyback fund with Frax's ARB airdrop to create ARB-FRAX liquidity.

Timeless Finance's protocol, bunni.pro , is pleased to submit this proposal to enable the Bunni-LP frxETH/WETH gauges in order to receive FXS rewards.

Background

Bunni is a protocol that was initially released in October 2022 built on top of Uniswap V3, which leverages its deep liquidity to offer a more capital-efficient trading experience for users. Bunni has a public utility that represents Uniswap v3 liquidity positions as fungible ERC-20 tokens instead of NFTs. This allows for more complex incentivization schemes to be created for Uniswap v3 liquidity. Since its initial release, Timeless has continued to improve and develop Bunni, turning it into a full-fledged liquidity engine, with improvements to its tokenomics inspired by protocols such as Balancer and Curve. Our platform has already facilitated over $194,248,029 in total volume with the FRAX/USDC pool and has over $4.5 million in TVL between the two pools in just three months.

Proposal

We propose that Frax Finance add a gauge for Bunni to further grow our relationship. Doing this should help with providing efficient deep liquidity while also adding to the flywheel effect created from TRC #010 https://gov.timelessfi.com/discussion/10204-trc10-direct-all-bunni-protocol-fees-towards-vote-incentives-on-bribe-markets . Our venomic-based gauges will offer incentives and free bribes coming from swap fees to LPs who participate in our liquidity optimization services. We believe that working together, we can create an even more robust ecosystem for Frax Finance LPs and holders.

Evaluation of Success

We will measure the success of our Frax Finance gauge by monitoring the liquidity and trading volume of frxETH/WETH liquidity pool along with bribe market stats and % of total veLIT votes the pool receive.

Conclusion

Bunni is excited to grow our relationship with Frax Finance by creating a more efficient and effective ecosystem for traders and LPs. Our liquidity optimization services and incentives will encourage LPs to use our platform and deepen liquidity. We look forward to partnering with Frax Finance and contributing to a better trading experience for everyone involved.

Zane Huffman (Metronome, Vesper Finance)

Jordan Kruger (Metronome, Vesper Finance)

Summary

Deploy a new factory pool to Curve: msETH-frxETH. Integrate pool into Convex and Frax Gauges with the help of Frax team.

Match CVX voting power towards the msETH-frxETH; msUSD-FraxBP pools.

Metronome and Vesper Finance to fully support frxETH and Frax through the full product suite.

Assess success over time and potentially extend this relationship to include further incentives per user demand, and extend support to FPI and FXS.

Revisions

This proposal is a revision of a previous proposal. The following changes were made:

CVX match reduced to 110,000 and broken down between msUSD-fraxBP and msETH-frxETH. sfrxETH collateral has already been deployed to Metronome.

Background and Motivation

Metronome is a multi-collateral, multi-synthetic platform that emphasizes productive collateral. Metronome is supported by the same Bloq team as sister project Vesper - a DeFi yield aggregator with several existing integrations unique to FRAX (Convex, Saddle).

Metronome intends to support productive assets, through Vesper or other yield platforms, as collateral to mint synthetic versions of popular assets. Users can swap those assets for a looping yield farming experience, trade those assets, take directional positions, and so on.

Specifically with regards to frxETH and LSD as a whole, Vesper + Metronome offers a uniquely powerful looping experience. Vesper enables a “yield-plus” experience (earn ETH staking APY plus DeFi strategy APY). Metronome offers fixed interest rates for minting synthetics, including an “msETH” synthetic. This combo enables the most capital efficient yield farming experience on LSD in the market today.

This mechanism extends towards FRAX (support already exists for FRAX on Vesper + vaFRAX on Metronome).

In return for deployment of this product suite and prioritization of Frax ecosystem assets, we seek to extend a formalized partnership around the projects, cemented through an incentives matching budget to deepen liquidity to the benefit of both communities.

Section 0: Pool Deployment

Frax team will aid Metronome to ensure that the prospective msETH-frxETH pool can be deployed properly across the full CRV/CVX/FXS gauge system, including proposal authorship and utilization of voting weight.

Section 1: Incentive Matching Budget

Frax team will match 110,000 CVX voting power towards this pool 1:1 with Metronome treasury voting through four voting cycles (~2 months). Metronome treasury currently holds roughly 165,000 CVX .

We intend to split the composite 220,000 CVX (110,000 matched 1:1) as follows: msUSD-FraxBP: 150,000 CVX msETH-frxETH: 70,000 CVX

This matching program will commence on the first voting cycle that sees msETH-frxETH properly integrated into Curve/Convex/Frax gauges.

Section 2: Frax integration throughout Metronome, Vesper

Currently, FRAX is supported on Vesper and both naked FRAX and vaFRAX are supported in Metronome. As of recently, sfrxETH is also integrated as collateral onto Metronome.

Vesper will additionally expand to support yield strategies on top of frxETH. This may include:

Curve-Convex frxETH-ETH LP

FraxLend sfrxETH-borrow-FRAX

Aave v3 sfrxETH-borrow-Stablecoins

Future strategies as they become available

The Vesper pool will be intended as sfrxETH APY-plus, giving users a higher APY exposure to frxETH. This pool will additionally be added to Metronome as collateral.

Section 3: Program Extension

The above agreements are intended to establish the Metronome + Vesper product suite within the Frax ecosystem for holders of both FRAX and FXS.

In particular, this system is intended to provide increased demand for frxETH and extension of supply by giving users a powerful strategy to take on a looping position for multiplied frxETH APY.

Should there be significant market demand for these products, this proposal may be extended after the 4-cycle agreement with a follow up proposal to continue CVX matching and/or introduce a bribe matching program.

In addition to FRAX and frxETH, Vesper can extend deployment to FXS and FPI pools, with the same intent purpose of inclusion in Metronome.

In the event of any multi-chain ambitions in the future, Vesper + Metronome can also be incorporated on those chains.

Lastly, both teams can discuss privileged opportunities for Frax assets, like a separate synthetics pool with better rates. This would require future governance activity through Metronome DAO.

Summary

Prioritize frxETH and FRAX throughout the Vesper + Metronome ecosystem, giving the users the opportunity to deposit and passively earn yield through Vesper and simultaneously post that productive position as collateral to Metronome.

Frax to match 110,000 CVX voting weight with Metronome for four voting cycles.

Frax ecosystem participants benefit in a number of ways:

New yield farming opportunities on frxETH + FRAX

Increased demand and potential supply expansion on frxETH, driving greater revenue back to Frax and veFXS holders.

Ability to take on directional, exotic positions on Frax ecosystem assets using a combination of Frax Finance collateral against misc. synthetic positions.

Routing of Frax assets throughout the broader DeFi ecosystem, driving relevant metrics like liquidity, borrow activity, trading volume, and so on

Background and Motivation

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space.

Background & Motivation:

Diversification of frxETH liquidity outside Ethereum.

Summary:

Balancer is becoming a leader in LSD pools across all networks, with staked assets as a key focus, and is hence a natural choice to create a liquidity sink for frxETH on Polygon. By diversifying frxETH liquidity beyond Ethereum, it allows the wider DeFi community to gain access to the Frax ecosystem.

This pool uses Balancer’s stable pool factory and contains FRAX’s wrapped ethereum token,Frax eth ( frxETH ) bridged via Frax Ferry and

Modified by: 01100010 01100111

Proposal

I propose the implementation of a ragequit function for the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool to address the needs of community members who wish to re-allocate their capital. This function will provide community members with greater flexibility and freedom in managing their capital while ensuring that the underlying protocol is not exposed to significant risk. The proposal also aims to generate profits for the protocol if passed.

The current FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool has seen minimal adoption with FRAX transaction volume since its inception, making it an ineffective and non-productive way to direct capital towards. The proposed solution is a ragequit function that will allow community members to exit their positions in the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool with a 20% fee.

Additional Information

It is important to note that the mStable project is facing challenges such as difficulty in raising capital, limited funds, and market strategy issues. Moreover, the project has stopped directing any MTA rewards to the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool.

Summary

This proposal aims to move the maximum lock time for all new gauges back to three years for a 3x boost on the Frax Finance protocol.

Background and Motivations

Currently, Frax Finance offers users the option to lock their tokens for one year in exchange for a 2x boost. However, this option has not proven more effective than the previous option of locking tokens for three years for a 3x boost. Therefore, we propose to move the lock option back to three years for a 3x boost. This change will only apply to FRAXOHM, clevUSD, msUSD, and future gauges, and the gauges deployed with a maximum one-year lock and 2x boost won’t be unlocked or redeployed.

By moving the lock option back to three years, we hope to achieve the following goals:

Encourage users to lock their tokens for a longer period, resulting in increased liquidity, trading volumes, protocol stability, and anti-reflexivity in the stablecoin peg.

Provide users with a more attractive incentive to lock their tokens, improving the platform's overall performance.

Increase user participation and engagement on the platform by giving them more flexibility and control over their tokens.

Vote

For: Move the maximum lock time for all new gauges back to three years for a 3x boost on the Frax Finance protocol.

Background and Motivation

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Any token part of a Chainlink data feed can be lent to borrowers or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Proposal to add USV/FraxBP to FXS gauge controller

Motivation:

Phuture has deployed a Curve v2 pool for USV/FRAXBP to instantiate USV's first decentralised exchange listing. We intend for this to be the canonical liquidity venue for USV as we grow our exposure to the Curve ecosystem. Success will directly grow volume and TVL to the FraxBP pool.

USV or USDC Savings Vault is a USDC bond ETF built using Notional's fixed rate lending market. It provides the holder with yield on their USDC via the investment into the underlying bonds the vault holds.

USV is currently yielding over 3.5% without leverage, yield paid in kind and all underlying bonds overcollateralised. We are excited to pairs this with the FraxBP programme to help contribute to the FRAX stablecoin usage and grow the fraxbp tvl. We also believe that a low risk yield bearing bond etf offers something different to the vast number of copy cat stable coin assets on Curve. This amplifies the attractiveness of the offering with native yield + additional yield driven by CRV.

We look forward to working collaboratively.

Zane Huffman (Metronome, Vesper Finance)

Jordan Kruger (Metronome, Vesper Finance)

Summary

Deploy a new factory pool to Curve: msETH-frxETH. Integrate pool into Convex and Frax Gauges with the help of Frax team.

Match CVX voting power towards the msETH-frxETH; msUSD-FraxBP pools.

Metronome and Vesper Finance to fully support frxETH and Frax through the full product suite.

Assess success over time and potentially extend this relationship to include further incentives per user demand, and extend support to FPI and FXS.

Background and Motivation

Metronome is a multi-collateral, multi-synthetic platform that emphasizes productive collateral. Metronome is supported by the same Bloq team as sister project

Vesper - a DeFi yield aggregator with several existing integrations unique to FRAX (Convex, Saddle).

Metronome intends to support productive assets, through Vesper or other yield platforms, as collateral to mint synthetic versions of popular assets. Users can swap those assets for a looping yield farming experience, trade those assets, take directional positions, and so on.

Specifically with regards to frxETH and LSD as a whole, Vesper + Metronome offers a uniquely powerful looping experience. Vesper enables a “yield-plus” experience (earn ETH staking APY plus DeFi strategy APY). Metronome offers fixed interest rates for minting synthetics, including an “msETH” synthetic. This combo enables the most capital efficient yield farming experience on LSD in the market today.

This mechanism extends towards FRAX (support already exists for FRAX on Vesper + vaFRAX on Metronome).

In return for deployment of this product suite and prioritization of Frax ecosystem assets, we seek to extend a formalized partnership around the projects, cemented through an incentives matching budget to deepen liquidity to the benefit of both communities.

Section 0: Pool Deployment

Frax team will aid Metronome to ensure that the prospective msETH-frxETH pool can be deployed properly across the full CRV/CVX/FXS gauge system, including proposal authorship and utilization of voting weight.

Section 1: Incentive Matching Budget

Frax team will match any CVX voting power towards this pool 1:1 with Metronome treasury voting through four voting cycles (~2 months) up to 165,000 CVX. Metronome treasury currently holds roughly 165,000 CVX .

These rewards may be split between msUSD-FraxBP and msETH-frxETH at the discretion of both teams, but intention will be to maintain a generalized 1:1 CVX match across that timespan.

This matching program will commence on the first voting cycle that sees msETH-frxETH properly integrated into Curve/Convex/Frax gauges.

Section 2: Frax integration throughout Metronome, Vesper

Currently, FRAX is supported on Vesper and both naked FRAX and vaFRAX are supported in Metronome.

Metronome will initially expand to support sfrxETH, enabling users to loop their position against msETH mintage (or msUSD) to multiply their APY.

Vesper will additionally expand to support yield strategies on top of frxETH. This may include:

Curve-Convex frxETH-ETH LP

FraxLend sfrxETH-borrow-FRAX

Future strategies as they become available

The Vesper pool will be intended as sfrxETH APY-plus, giving users a higher APY exposure to frxETH. This pool will additionally be added to Metronome as collateral.

Section 3: Program Extension

The above agreements are intended to establish the Metronome + Vesper product suite within the Frax ecosystem for holders of both FRAX and FXS.

In particular, this system is intended to provide increased demand for frxETH and extension of supply by giving users a powerful strategy to take on a looping position for multiplied frxETH APY.

Should there be significant market demand for these products, this proposal may be extended after the 4-cycle agreement with a follow up proposal to continue CVX matching and/or introduce a bribe matching program.

In addition to FRAX and frxETH, Vesper can extend deployment to FXS and FPI pools, with the same intent purpose of inclusion in Metronome.

In the event of any multi-chain ambitions in the future, Vesper + Metronome can also be incorporated on those chains.

Lastly, both teams can discuss privileged opportunities for Frax assets, like a separate synthetics pool with better rates. This would require future governance activity through Metronome DAO.

Summary

Prioritize frxETH and FRAX throughout the Vesper + Metronome ecosystem, giving the users the opportunity to deposit and passively earn yield through Vesper and simultaneously post that productive position as collateral to Metronome.

Frax to match CVX voting weight with Metronome, up-to Metronome’s 165,000 CVX stake, for four voting cycles.

Frax ecosystem participants benefit in a number of ways:

New yield farming opportunities on frxETH + FRAX

Increased demand and potential supply expansion on frxETH, driving greater revenue back to Frax and veFXS holders.

Ability to take on directional, exotic positions on Frax ecosystem assets using a combination of Frax Finance collateral against misc. synthetic positions.

Routing of Frax assets throughout the broader DeFi ecosystem, driving relevant metrics like liquidity, borrow activity, trading volume, and so on

Voting

For: Authorize a CVX voting match of up-to 165,000 CVX for four voting cycles.

Against: Do nothing.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0xda26f181df9014367a1dfeb597c376e17c7b4d1b92fd7555cc3d010cb37b1be2

Summary

This proposal (part of three separate proposals) seeks to approve a budget of $100k worth of FXS or cvxCRV in bribes for a pilot bribe program (3 months) to veBAL or AURA holders (only where profitable to do so) to boost liquidity to the

2pool (BB-E-FRAX | BB-E-USDC) or other pools pairing with 2pool.

Background & Motivation

Frax has become the master of the Curve wars and Balancer is another frontier. There is a lot of utility and liquidity over at Balancer making use of its unique product offerings. For example things like 20%/80% pools which many protocols prefer for governance token liquidity, and LBP for token launches coordinated through PrimeDAO and Fjord Foundry. Also protocols like Olympus are stationing their main liquidity pools over on Balancer.

Balancer also has the ability for protocols to have deployed liquidity in boosted pools such as the pool referred to in this proposal. These pools have the following advantages:

High Capital Efficiency

Boosted Pools are designed to deliver high capital efficiency by enabling users to provide trade liquidity for common tokens while forwarding idle tokens to external protocols. This gives liquidity providers the benefits of Euler on top of the swap fees they collect from trades.

Superfluid, Consolidated Liquidity

Nesting pool tokens creates a powerful avenue to make swaps between any stablecoin and underlying borrowing protocol tokens in the Boosted Pool. On top of that, any token in a pool with a Boosted Pool Token can tap directly into the underlying tokens.

Example of an already deployed USD pool

We need FRAX to be everywhere and Balancer is likely to be a part of the overall mix when it comes to medium-term liquidity destinations.

Relevantly, Aura proposes to be the Convex of the Balancer ecosystem and AURA holders direct the veBAL locked as auraBAL. It can be more economical to bribe AURA holders than veBAL holders directly to direct BAL rewards to a preferred pool.

Presently there is a profitable opportunities for bribing veBAL or veAura holders.

The 2pool

The 2pool (BB-E-FRAX | BB-E-USDC) would be initially funded by an AMO deposit of liquidity and allow trades between FRAX and USDC in a capital efficient manner - while earning lending interest from Euler. It would also allow nesting of other tokens with the 2pool for example frxETH-2pool, FXS-2pool, FPI-2pool, etc, and allow direct trading between USDC or FRAX and the nested token (for example ETH->FRAX, ETH->USDC). This can also serve as a rail between Curve liquidity and Balancer liquidity.

The 2pool has been deployed by Balancer core team at

Proposal Summary

Set the target collateral ratio (CR) of the Frax protocol to 100%.  The increase in the CR will be achieved over time through protocol growth and earnings.

This proposal does not include minting any FXS to increase the CR.

Abstract

The time has come for Frax to gradually remove the algorithmic backing of the protocol.  The Frax protocol has grown and evolved dramatically since the protocol launched in December 2020.  The original protocol included a variable collateral ratio which adjusted based on the market demand of FRAX, effectively letting the market dictate how much collateral was necessary for each FRAX to equal $1.00.  This was a highly innovative, elegant approach that Frax pioneered but has now outgrown.  The costs of being slightly undercollateralized now far outweigh the benefits – especially because it can undermine the perceived safety of FRAX.  Gradually shifting the protocol to 100% CR is the best path forward for the long-term health and growth of the protocol.

This is a significant change to the protocol that over time effectively retires the algorithmic backing of Frax.  It has become clear to many active in the community that this is the best path forward.  The intention of this proposal is to coordinate the community on increasing the CR to 100% permanently.  It is more focused on the destination (100% CR) than how we get there - there is no imminent need to increase the CR and there are many ways of reaching the target CR.  Ideally growth, asset appreciation and protocol earnings will increase the CR to 100% over time.  To be clear, this proposal does not rely on minting any FXS to achieve the 100% CR.

Background and Motivation

Frax has always approached the algorithmic backing of FRAX conservatively.  Even before launch, it was clear that relying on FXS to back the algorithmic portion of FRAX required locked liquidity to ensure smooth functioning of the protocol.  Unfortunately, we have now seen many projects that didn’t understand this and failed.  The downside of locked liquidity is that the protocol pays for it in the form of FXS rewards.

While this approach made sense to start, the circumstances around Frax have changed.  Frax achieved 0 to 1 product market fit and now has a supply exceeding 1,000,000,000 FRAX.  The next phase of growth requires increasing the “money” attributes of FRAX, specifically making FRAX an asset that users are comfortable holding, without any incentive, as a long-term store of value.  The small algorithmic backing of FRAX creates the perception that FRAX is the less safe option for users to hold, especially after UST’s failure tainted the algorithmic stablecoin concept (whether fairly or unfairly).  There is very little benefit in maintaining the current CR of 92%. @dennett has made the point that FRAX can be fully collateralized by non-FXS assets and still be fractional reserve by deploying protocol owned liquidity via AMOs.  Increasing protocol collateral also means that additional collateral can be deployed via AMOs to create liquidity and revenue for the protocol.  Frax will continue to be the most capital efficient safe stablecoin while removing the need to constantly fund locked liquidity.  At this point, all protocol expansions occur via AMO and effectively are at 100% CR.  This means that protocol growth increases the CR.

The gentlest way to increase the CR is to retain protocol earnings as the protocol grows.  As part of this proposal, FXS buybacks will be deferred until the CR reaches 100%.  This is effectively an investment in the future of Frax that will increase protocol assets and remove the need for FXS emissions towards locked liquidity.  There appears to be little impact from FXS buybacks lately and the impact is probably overestimated at this point.  This proposal does not impact the current veFXS yield.  From the perspective of FXS holders, this proposal should increase the soundness / perception of Frax and accelerate protocol growth.

Finally, this proposal would authorize protocol comptrollers to strategically exchange up to $3m of protocol assets for frxETH each month.  frxETH is becoming an important decentralized asset on Frax’s balance sheet, both increasing the CR while also increasing the supply of frxETH and validators.  frxETH also offers a strong return potential for the protocol.  Up to $3m per month is a small amount given the size of Frax’s protocol assets – it also limits the protocol’s exposure to frxETH price volatility by keeping the value relatively small.  The selling of protocol assets authorized by this proposal is not intended to decrease Frax’s holdings of CVX or CRV and will not include either asset.

Proposal

This proposal approves the following changes:

I.  Increase the target collateral ratio to 100%.  This is the long-term target of the protocol and will require time to reach.  No FXS will be minted to achieve this target.  As part of this change, the protocol is retiring the algorithmic backing of FRAX and the decollateralize function.

II. Retain protocol revenue to fund the increased CR, including pausing FXS buybacks.  veFXS yield remains the same.

III.    Authorize up to $3m per month in frxETH purchases to increase the CR.

For - Approve the changes described above, including setting the long term target CR of Frax to 100%

Proposal

I propose the implementation of a ragequit function for the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool to address the needs of community members who wish to re-allocate their capital. This function will provide community members with greater flexibility and freedom in managing their capital while ensuring that the underlying protocol is not exposed to significant risk. The proposal also aims to generate profits for the protocol if passed.

The current FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool has seen minimal adoption with FRAX transaction volume since its inception, making it an ineffective and non-productive way to direct capital towards. The proposed solution is a ragequit function that will allow community members to exit their positions in the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool with a daily slash rate calculated at 8% per year.

Additional Information

It is important to note that the mStable project is facing challenges such as difficulty in raising capital, limited funds, and market strategy issues. Moreover, the project has stopped directing any MTA rewards to the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool.

This proposal is a request to add Sentiment’s FRAX Lending Pool (LFRAX) to FXS gauge controller

Background :

Sentiment is an undercollateralized credit protocol on Arbitrum, allowing borrowers to access up to 5x capital on their collateral value. (Put up whitelisted collateral -> borrow assets from lending pools, up to 5x collateral value)

Borrowers are “confined” within a Sentiment “account”, but users have the ability to deploy borrowed capital within Sentiment-whitelisted yield strategies — such as a variety of Convex & Balancer LP tokens (FRAX/USDC for example), lending on Aave, wstETH, etc. (thus cannot run away with debt & account simply fully liquidated when health factor < 1.2 ((debt + collateral value)/debt owed). An example of a strategy users can deploy using Sentiment is:

Deposit 100 $FRAX as collateral

Borrow 500 $FRAX as debt

Deploy into FRAX/USDC  Curve Pool

Earn 5x rewards APY from Curve pool and Gauge

Motivation :

While using Sentiment for various strategies has worked in an extremely robust fashion (over $8mm in volume since inception, with the majority coming from stablecoin borrowing → depositing in Convex stable LPs), it’s definitely been tougher to attract lenders due to inherent risk/yield misalignment at the moment, especially given lenders on Sentiment currently cannot borrow against their lent assets, and Sentiment currently does not have a protocol token, thus no direct liquidity mining. As such, we’re pursuing a veFXS gauge for our FRAX lending market (LFRAX) in order to bolster more liquidity (already have an OTC bribe set up). Having a Frax gauge can allow us to incentivize more liquidity, which would create more available FRAX to borrow at a lower interest rate than other stables on our platform. Borrowers will then be able to deposit FRAX in FRAXBP and other FRAX-native yield strategies we hope to integrate in the future. This could create net deeper FRAX liquidity on Arbitrum!

Proposal

We would live for Sentiment to have a veFXS gauge for our FRAX lending pool. We believe with Sentiment’s user demand for borrowing capital and attractive FRAX yield strategies that exist on Arbitrum a Frax gauge could increase FRAX liquidity and distribution on Arbitrum, while increasing Lending liquidity on Sentiment.

Proposal to add VST/FraxBP to FXS gauge controller

Pool / Token: 0x63171ae9a9886e49547dd40adb70f04eaba39d6b

Motivation:

After conversations between the Vesta and the Frax teams, we’ve concluded that migrating the VST-FRAX pool to a VST-FRAXBP Curve pool would benefit both protocols.

VST is minted directly by users by opening a vault and depositing ETH, GMX, DPX, gOHM, and GLP as collateral. The available collaterals make VST one of the most decentralized stablecoins on the market. VST has seen more than 300k in volume consistently in the past 6 months (>2m on some days), making it one of the highest-traded stablecoins on Arbitrum. This volume has benefitted FRAX as well, driving lots of volume to Arbitrum FRAX.

We hope to further our collaboration via migrating the current VST-FRAX pool to a new VST-FRAXBP pool. Such a pool will drive more volume to the FRAXBP pool. The addition of USDC to the base assets of the LP makes it more attractive for liquidity providers, deepening liquidity for both VST and FRAX as a result. Therefore we suggests the addition of a new gauge for the VST-FRAXBP pool on Frax.

Summary

This proposal aims to describe the frxETHBP and WETHR program and authorize an allocation of incentives to increase liquidity in AMMs, DAOs, and protocols with an underlying token of frxETH.

Background and Motivation

Frax Ether is a liquid ETH staking derivative designed to uniquely leverage the Frax Finance ecosystem to maximize staking yield and smooth the Ethereum staking process for a simplified, secure, and DeFi-native way to earn interest on ETH.

In just 85 days, frxETH has gone from 0 to 50k in supply, which was an essential milestone for Frax and highlighted the success of its design. But it also shows that Frax Finance has a great product that can be quickly adopted by the mass market.

However, as we look to the future, it's essential to focus on creating deep liquidity for frxETH. This will improve the trading experience for current holders, make it more attractive for new users to enter the market, and drive further adoption.

The WETHR (WETH Replacement) program is an incentive system made to make frxETH a viable alternative to WETH in smart contracts after Shanghai withdrawals are live.

Proposal Details

We propose allocating a budget for incentives to increase liquidity in AMMs with underlying tokens of frxETH. sfrxETH in liquidity pools or protocols is not eligible for this program. sfrxETH can receive their own independent incentives through the gauge system. The frxETH incentives include, but are not limited to, the following actions:

Bribing Gauge votes

Vote with protocol voting power

The Frax core team will spend it for frxETH liquidity proportional to the number of tokens in the liquidity pools, and using incentives will be AMM agnostic so that they can be used for any AMM platforms such as Curve, Fraxswap, etc.

Budget:

The budget for this proposal will be the farming rewards from frxETH and sfrxETH pools held by the frxETH Treasury and a maximum of $2.4 million worth of FXS from the bi-weekly Votium budget (

FIP ) that can be spent for any AMM platform. It should be noted that this is the maximum amount that will be used for incentives and not necessarily the exact amount.

Proposal

For: Authorize an allocation of incentives to increase liquidity in AMMs with an underlying token of frxETH, with the mentioned details.

DeFi Dave

Proposal

Grant Flywheel $214.2k (50% in FRAX/50% in FXS) over the next year to continue activities promoting the Frax ecosystem and producing high-quality DeFi content.

Background

Over the past 6 months, the relationship between Flywheel and Frax has done nothing but blossom and has played a pivotal role in shaping the narrative about Frax. The Frax Core Team have proven themselves to be the most talented builders in all of DeFi, shipping a plethora of primitives over the past year. But before Flywheel existed, Frax did not have an effective strategy for promoting their brand or educating the wider public. As the old mantra goes, if a tree falls in the forest and there is no one there to hear it, does it make a sound? It was clear that the Frax ecosystem needed assistance on that front and that help was not going to come from anywhere else but the community. [ You can read more about Flywheel and its performance over the last grant period in the original post in

Frax Governance forum. ]

Proposed Grant and Budget Breakdown

Total Cost: $214.2k

Half of the grant will be streamed via llamapay and half the grant will be granted lump sum at the end of the year.

Of what is streamed via llamapay it will be 80% FXS and 20% FRAX. Of the lump sum it will be 80% FRAX and 20% FXS

Grant Components $104k to produce weekly episodes of Flywheel $52k to produce weekly episodes of Frax Check $25k for IRL Events $15.6k for business development representation $10k to produce Frax-branded merchandise $5.1k for patronizing art and content $2.5k for Frax-branded NFTs

Extra Note

Section in 2024 grant proposal about the progress of independent income streams of Flywheel.

Team

And just like last time, the people who are leading this initiative are:

Sam McCulloch ( @traders_insight ) long-time member of the Frax community. Executive producer of all content, co-host of Frax Check, contributor to the Flywheel website.

DeFi Dave ( @defidave22 ) Day Zero Fraximalist. Co-host of Flywheel and Frax Check, contributor to the Flywheel website. kapital_k (

0xkapital_k ) DeFi/Gaming/Tokenomics enthusiast and early Frax supporter. Co-host of Flywheel and Frax Check.

Motivation

Flywheel has firmly established its role in the ecosystem as the destination for information and alpha regarding Frax. As an organic development, Flywheel essentially fills the role of a marketing department and due to its quality and reach is able to reach the target audience Frax is looking for. Yet like any department, Flywheel still needs funds to keep the lights on in order to continue pushing content out as well as interact with the wider community in a thoughtful and genuine manner. We hope with this round of funding we will be able to keep performing our duty as stewards of the Frax ecosystem and spreading Frax far and wide as it enters the next stage of its development.

From the motivation section of our last proposal, there are still several points that ring true. Flywheel still aims to be the “Bankless of Frax” and take the wheel in driving the narrative for Frax and Foundational Deep DeFi forward. There is simply just too much at stake to do nothing and merely “hope for the best”, we need to keep actively engaging the wider DeFi community and beyond in order to inform, educate, and entertain them about Frax and its surrounding ecosystem. We strongly believe that Frax will reach Ethereum-level in size and along the way, Frax can not only scale technologically on-chain, but must scale socially off-chain as well.

Flywheel has done an excellent job representing Frax so far and we are here to keep pushing the momentum forward. As mentioned in the last two proposals, the Frax ecosystem is growing to become much bigger than the core team alone and numerous contributors and commentators have arisen that have helped advance the protocol into the future. Flywheel is here to organize and shine a light on Frax, carrying the Fraximalist torch up high for those who seek it.

CLever Core Team

Summary

Allocate 300000 $vlCVX votes for clevUSD/FraxBP for the next 6 epochs.  In exchange, CLever will offer Frax 15,000 CLEV tokens (0.75% of supply) vested over 3 months from the first vote.

Background

CLever is a risk-minimized lending platform for high quality tokens such as CVX and FRAX. CLever loans are denominated in clevTokens, which are assets paired to their specific collateral and representing its future yield. clevTokens are treated as equivalent to their respective collateral by the system, so they carry no risk of liquidation and no exposure to price oracles. CLever does not charge interest on loans, but instead a fixed rate on yield harvests, which means borrowing costs do not change with any pool utilization or liquidity.

CLever FRAX allows users to mint clevUSD against several Frax-based stablecoin collateral strategies, each with its own maximum LTV and independent yield. For CLever FRAX, all yields are swapped into FRAX, which is used to pay down their clevUSD system debt 1:1, then distributed via a stability mechanism called the Furnace.

In order for borrowers to utilize their borrowed tokens, CLever provides incentivized swap pools pairing each clevToken with its associated collateral. Sufficient liquidity in these pools facilitates swapping with reasonable slippage, and incentives create a yield farming opportunity for LPs of liquid FRAX with a unique risk profile. Since clevTokens represent future yield rather than a pegged asset (see next section) LP pairs are correlated, limiting the scope of impermanent loss to LPs and making these farms unique in the market. clevTokens are not wrappers of their underlying collateral tokens. Instead they represent future yield generated by collateral strategies, denominated in the collateral tokens. clevTokens can only be minted against their associated collateral, and only up to the maximum LTV for each given strategy (currently 30-50% for FRAX).  During bootstrapping CLever also imposes an overall borrowing limit for each strategy.  These limits will be raised as liquidity grows. clevTokens can eventually all be exchanged for corresponding real collateral tokens at 1:1 via the Furnace, so they can be considered a zero coupon bond with indefinite maturity. If the furnace currently holds collateral tokens the swap is immediate, but users can deposit clevTokens to the Furnace even if there are no collateral tokens currently available. In this case, users share the upcoming harvests proportionally with any other Furnace depositors. New harvests to the Furnace are released linearly over 1-2 weeks (depending on the collateral) which creates a smooth continuous burn rate/bond repayment and prevents timing exploits when the system is oversubscribed. The time required to convert clevTokens into their real underlying asset via the Furnace is determined by the collateral yield rate(s), as well as how many clevTokens are sharing those harvests in the Furnace.

Since clevTokens represent future assets rather than current ones, they can trade at a discount representing the time value of those tokens like any bond. Borrowers swap when the discount is sufficiently small and, on the other side of the equation, users can buy clevTokens from the Curve pool to arbitrage the discount. This arbitrage can be repeatedly looped between the Furnace and the Curve pool as the Furnace converts clevTokens to their paired collateral assets.

CLEV Tokenomics

CLEV is CLever’s native token and it uses Curve’s ve- tokenomic system, with lockers sharing platform revenue and progressively increasing governance power. CLever applies fees to the collateral token harvest yield, the majority of which will be distributed to veCLEV holders. This makes liquidity mining (or bribe payments) more sustainable than simple inflation because CLEV is a proxy for real, ongoing platform revenue in CVX, FRAX, and any future collateral tokens. The operation of CLever makes it a net buyer of CVX and FRAX. Locking CLEV is marketed as a set-and-forget way to earn a growing stable of hodl-worthy tokens.

Motivation:

Increasing liquidity and visibility for the clevUSD/FRAXBP pool is critical to the operation of CLever. It would also be beneficial and additive to the ecosystem in the following ways:

CLever’s model directly supports demand for underlying collateral strategies like FRAXBP farms by facilitating the creation of leveraged farming positions.

CLever provides unique new farming opportunities and by creation of yield bond markets and (liquid) clevToken-collateral farming.

Proposal

In order to create a deeper pool and to attract liquidity which will support clveUSD - Frax swaps we propose that Frax vote with 300,000 vlCVX for the clevUSD/FRAXBP pool for the next 6 epochs on Votium. In exchange, CLever will offer Frax 15,000 CLEV tokens (0.75% of supply) vested over 3 months from the first vote.

For:

Allocate 300000 $vlCVX votes for clevUSD/FraxBP for the next 6 epochs.

Proposal

I propose the implementation of a ragequit function, similar to [FIP-123] , to address the needs of community members who wish to re-allocate their capital. This ragequit function would provide community members with more flexibility and freedom in managing their capital, while also ensuring that the underlying protocol is not effected with significant risk and also makes a profit if this proposal passes.

As pointed out by the community members, the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool has seen minimal adoption with FRAX transaction volume since existence, making it an ineffective and non-productive way to direct capital towards.

The proposed solution is a ragequit function that would allow community members to exit their positions in the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool with a 10% slash.

Additional information

It is worth mentioning that the mStable project is facing challenges such as difficulty in raising capital, limited funds, and market strategy issues, additionally, the project has stopped directing any MTA rewards to this pool.

SUMMARY:

Deploy an FXS gauge for the

Saddle

L2D4 pool (FRAX, USDs, USX, alUSD pool on Arbitrum), which will be co-incentivized by Sperax, dForce, Alchemix, L2DAO, and Saddle.

Saddle pool address:

L2D4

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION:

The current stablecoin market is dominated by three major players: USDC, USDT, DAI.

While these coins have proven to be mostly reliable in terms of stability and usecase, they also come with certain limitations and risks.

L2D4 intends to offer a focused alternative to the standard, act as a catalyst for rebalancing the markets in favour of less centralised offering, and offer direct swap paths through aligned protocol stablecoins/stablecoin derivatives.

With bribe proposals passed by the constituent protocols, and additional bribes coming from both Layer2DAO and Saddle, establishing a gauge for the pool would represent a massive opportunity to break into Arbitrum for veFXS hodlers-- allowing them to acquire 6 governance tokens and a major footing in the ecosystem in exchange for their votes.

VOTING:

For: Deploy an FXS gauge for Saddle's L2D4 LP token

15,000,000 FRAX

25,000,000 FRAX

Background and Motivation

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows the creation of a money market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Any token that is part of a Chainlink data feed can be lent to borrowers, or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. Fraxlend creates new financial opportunities for all users and promotes FRAX adoption in the DeFi community.

Since FIP - 137 authorized the Fraxlend AMO to issue a new FPI pair ( FPI/FRAX - Variable Rate V2 ), the pool has generated significant protocol revenues, as well as heavy lending and borrowing activity. Current pool utilization stands at 91% with total FPI collateral value at $17.8m. At time of writing, the lender APY is at 5.7% and borrower APY is at 6.2%. Both rates are rising quickly.

Building on the success of the FPI pool, additional AMO injected liquidity would help bring the target pool utilization back down to the nominal range of 75% to 85%. More importantly, raising the liquidity cap would expand and diversify the borrower base to increase financial access for all users.

We note that authorizing the new higher limit does not require the AMO to provide the specified liquidity. The liquidity will be authorized and available to be injected, consistent with the AMO operations framework and protocol risk parameters, to meet user demand as deemed appropriate by the Frax Team.

Proposal

For: Increase maximum authorized allocation of Fraxlend AMO for the mentioned pair.

Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Summary

Authorization for revoting failed FIPs that have surpassed the quorum with a cool-down period.

Background and Details

In Frax Finance, we value our veFXS holders' time and opinion and stand by all votes that reach quorum, even if they are rejections. But in the unlikely case that one of these proposals was rejected when it should not have been for any reason, this proposal creates an opportunity to revote.

We propose a dynamic cool-down period for revoting failed FIPs that have surpassed the quorum with the following conditions:

Vote Participation

Cool-Down Period for Revoting

1 x Quorum < Participation < 2 x Quorum

30 days

2 x Quorum < Participation < 3 x Quorum

60 days

3 x Quorum < Participation < 4 x Quorum

90 days

4 x Quorum < Participation < 5 x Quorum

120 days

5 x Quorum < Participation < 6 x Quorum

150 days

6 x Quorum < Participation

180 days

P.S. For FIPs that have not hit quorum once but met 90% of quorum, we still use the

FIP-102 policy.

Summary

Deploy an FXS gauge for Convex wrapped position of

OHM-FRAXBP Curve Pool LP .

Curve Pool Address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xfc1e8bf3e81383ef07be24c3fd146745719de48d

Motivation

OlympusDAO has recently been in discussions with Frax Finance team which led to the conclusion that the migration of the Fraxswap OHM-Frax pool to an OHM-FraxBP Curve pool would be beneficial to both protocols. Indeed, we believe the combination of Olympus Treasury governance power over the Curve-Convex & Frax ecosystems as well as the FraxBP incentives program, will help make this pool attractive for external liquidity providers, deepening liquidity for both OHM & Frax as a result.

Continuing the push to incentivize FraxBP pools, this proposal will add gauges for Convex wrapped positions of the SDT/FraxBP pool.

NB: If this proposal passes, Stake DAO will be able to create the corresponding Frax strategy, therefore adding SDT incentives on top of the FXS incentives.

Abstract

Add an FXS gauge for the following Convex pool: SDT/FraxBP

The staking token is a wrapped Convex staking position represented by an erc-20 that receives CRV and CVX rewards. This token can then be staked on a Frax Finance gauge to then also receive FXS rewards.

The wrapped staking position itself is an unmanaged trustless position and can be found on the Convex github at platform/ConvexStakingWrapperFrax.sol

Furthermore, if the proposal passes, the bribes deposited by Frax for this pool will be deposited on the Votemarket platform: a fully on-chain platform enabling to bribe directly veCRV, as a test for further usage of this platform.

For: Add the listed pools to FXS gauge controller as staked Convex positions

"[FIP - 142] Frax Gauges on KyberSwap Elastic Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism","[FIP - 142] Frax Gauges on KyberSwap Elastic Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism","Dec 5, 2022 · 11:33 AM","Dec 5, 2022 · 11:33 AM","Dec 10, 2022 · 11:33 AM","1. Summary:

The outcome of this proposal is to make a FRAX pool one of the base pools on Kyber AMM’s stable swap on 4 chains Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism.

In addition, Kyber has also had a successful campaign supporting Lido wstETH and stMATIC liquidity on 4 chains, and would like to run a similar campaign for Frax sfrxETH.

Through a combination of diverse pairings as well as our custom fee tiers, we can drive more volume through FRAX pools as well as sfrxETH pools.

Background and motivation:

KyberSwap Elastic AMM is a new tick-based AMM with high efficiency pools and liquidity settings which has ranked among the top DEXs across all chains in just four months since launch. With concentrated liquidity, Kyber performs especially well with stable pairs, as proven through the performance of its QiDAO $MAI pools and Lido $wstETH and $stMATIC pools.

Currently, there is a significant amount of TVL locked in both UniSwap and Curve, but this TVL is not being put in an efficient use where it can generate a decent amount of volume. In addition, Frax just launched wstETH-sfrxETH-rETH pool on Balancer with 1M of TVL but the pool does not have any volume till date. With FRAX pools as one of the stable base pools on Kyber, this can be fixed.

2. Kyber Recommendation:

We recommend gauges for the following pairs, which are built to optimize for and increase FRAX and sfrxETH volume:

Ethereum:

Add these following pools:

FRAX - USDC (Fee tiers 0.01% or 0.04%)

FRAX - frxETH (Fee tiers 0.04%)

And add one of the following pools: frxETH - ETH (Fee tiers 0.01% or 0.04%) sfrxETH - wstETH (Fee tiers 0.04%) sfrxETH - FRAX (Fee tiers 0.3%)

Polygon

Add this pool:

FRAX - USDC (Fee tiers 0.04%)

Arbitrum

Add this pool:

FRAX - USDC (Fee tiers 0.04%)

Optimism

Add this pool:

FRAX - USDC (Fee tiers 0.01%)

3. Benefits:

Increased liquidity efficiency: Liquidity is not only optimized for volume across more diverse pairs and custom fee settings, but also benefits from custom routing through KyberSwap’s DEX Aggregator.

Partnership with a reputable and long term AMM protocol, which currently ranks 5 to 6 out of all DEXs across all chains (rank 2 on both Arbitrum and Optimism), in terms of daily volume. Current daily volume is at around $70m.

Co-marketing with a project which has a strong community and good traction across the four proposed ecosystems.

4. About Kyber

Our product KyberSwap - an AMM model - also shares several product features as UniSwap V3 in terms of concentrated liquidity, utilizing the tick-based method and using NFTs to represent liquidity positions.

The key differences are: a. Re-investment curves: Whereas the LP fees on UniV3 are only claimable separately, KyberSwap Elastic has a reinvestment curve: LP fees on KyberSwap Elastic are claimable in a separate compounding pool [full range 50/50], meaning more returns for LPs.

Compounding comparison:

UniV2/KyberSwap Classic: Fees compound into original position, most earnings

KyberSwap Elastic: Fees compound separately, middle earnings

UniV3: Fees don’t compound, claimable separately, least earnings b. Just-in-time (snipping attack) protection: KyberSwap Elastic also offers snipe/just-in-time protection. When a swap is executed, one can supply liquidity, swap into his own liquidity at a narrow range and skim the pool of fees, so the pool LP makes less:

More IL because less fees.

Some aggregators might use JIT as a way to find the best rates.

Somewhat similar to a front running attack.

Our performance with LM has proven to be very strong on volume/tvl ratio: with only 54M in TVL we can facilitate almost 100M in daily trading volume.

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Any token part of a Chainlink data feed can be lent to borrowers or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Proposal

Background & Motivation

Continuing the push to incentivize FraxBP pools, this proposal will add gauges for Convex wrapped positions of the following pools.

Abstract

Add a FXS gauge for the following Convex pools:

RSR/FraxBP

The staking token is a wrapped Convex staking position represented by an erc-20 that receives CRV and CVX rewards. This token can then be staked on a Frax Finance gauge to then also receive FXS rewards.

The wrapped staking position itself is an unmanaged trustless position and can be found on the Convex github at platform/ConvexStakingWrapperFrax.sol

Deploy an FXS gauge for Convex wrapped position of

XAI-FRAXBP Curve Pool LP .

Curve Pool Address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x326290a1b0004eee78fa6ed4f1d8f4b2523ab669

Background & Motivation

Silo [ www.silo.finance ] is a risk-isolated lending protocol that creates permissionless money markets. In our lending protocol, each market (or ‘silo’) consists of a base asset such as $FRAX and two bridge assets, ETH and our stablecoin XAI. Borrowers in each silo (market) are only exposed to the risk of 3 assets at any time rather than all the assets in the protocol. We have long had good standing with the Frax team with Sam serving as an indispensable advisor, and our decision to pair our governance token $SILO with FRAX on Curve.

XAI is Silo’s over-collateralized stablecoin with a soft peg to the US Dollar. The SiloDAO is the only entity that controls XAI. Via executive proposals, the SiloDAO can choose to mint unlimited XAI and deposit it into any number of silos. Similarly, the DAO can burn XAI that is extended to any silos via governance proposals. When the DAO mints XAI into a silo, it effectively determines XAI’s backing. Similarly, when the DAO burns XAI in a silo, it changes XAI’s backing. After the recent passing of SIP-19, the current backing of XAI is 66.66% ETH and 33.33% USDC.

Benefits of XAI-FRAXBP Gauge:

Silo Finance will seed the pool with 3M USD XAI-FRAXBP.

Silo Finance will provide Incentives through our 260,000 vlCVX.

Future Areas of Collaboration:

Following this proposal, Silo Finance has scoped and is ready to propose multiple collaboration efforts with the Frax community. In the future, you can expect to see the following potential partnerships coming into Frax governance for discussion: sFRAX Gauge: A gauge for Frax staked in the Frax Silo akin to aFRAX. frxETH/sfrxETH Silo: Silo Finance will work to enable a silo for frxETH further expanding its use case. We would also be more than happy to extend credit lines into this market.

We invite the Frax community to also voice their support/critique regarding these efforts.

Summary

Create a gauge for the FXS-FRAX pair on Fraxlend.

Background and Motivation

Fraxlend effectively allows the Frax protocol (via Fraxlend AMOs) to mint FRAX against various collateral types.  In most cases, the overcollateralized nature of the loans also increases the overall protocol collateral ratio.  This is probably the best method that is currently available to increase the protocol collateral ratio.

Minting FRAX against the FXS-FRAX pair on Fraxlend actually does the opposite as it increases the amount of FXS that is backing Frax.  This limits the liquidity that the protocol can add to the FXS-FRAX Fraxlend pair (via the AMO ) without decreasing the collateral ratio.  The FXS-FRAX pair currently has about 50% less liquidity than any other pair on Fraxlend because of these constraints.  I have heard from users that want to use this pair but need increased liquidity in order to do so.

Deep liquidity on the FXS-FRAX pair benefits the protocol in a number of ways: increasing usage for Fraxlend, FRAX, and providing FXS holders the ability to access liquidity against FXS without selling their FXS.  As a borrower, it's important that there is sufficient liquidity to prevent extreme interest rate volatility that requires active management of the position (aside from collateral management).  Creating a gauge for the Fraxlend FXS-FRAX pair is the best means of creating deep liquidity for the FXS-FRAX pair without negatively impacting the protocol's collateral ratio.

Greenlight collaboration on the design of a PropFi AMO to allocate stable liquidity to an initial property pool of high yielding single family real estate (SFR) assets.

Background and Motivation:

PropFi is a real world asset (RWA) investment protocol, which will enable on-chain exposure to broadly diversified property portfolios, as well as other real world assets. PropFi has partnered with a number of firms which traditionally provide institutional-grade acquisition, development, and property management services to large insurance companies and private equity entities.

The sum total of this approach enables exposure to RWA at significant scale, in an on-chain environment. The PropFi solution also seeks to disrupt traditional REITs (both public and private equity) by using DeFi infrastructure to provide far greater efficiency, and thus higher net returns, greater liquidity, and unprecedented transparency.

Focusing initially on SFR due to its resilience, relatively low volatility, low correlation with crypto investments, and stable yields, the protocol takes advantage of several unique characteristics that place it above previous attempts at incorporation of real estate or other RWAs into the blockchain space.

These include: -Scalability - working in close partnership with a nationwide tech-forward institutional manager  capable of deploying $125M per month in capital (and climbing), manage 200+ simultaneous renovations, and get us access to economies of scale in portfolio insurance, financing, and liquidity. -Frictionless user experience (easy on-chain  access to institutional grade portfolios of properties, without needing to leave the blockchain infrastructure layer, no hassle of withdrawals or bank transfers etc)

This is a particularly opportune time for integrating RWA to on-chain investment strategies, as it provides secondary access for institutional grade capital to the digital asset space, while offering digital native investors and protocols easy and seamless exposure to a countercyclical market hedge. This effectively enables preservation of wealth and provision of relatively high yields, even during crypto market drawdowns.

Propfi will seek to deploy a $25-$50 million genesis pool of properties within the next 6-12 months, at such time as our advisors feel the macro picture is advantageous. This will be done within geographic regions targeting a 7-10% average total net annual return for all capital deployed into property (rental yield + capital growth).

In the interim, Propfi will seek to deploy invested funds into high interest very low risk cash and cash equivalent options.

Background & Motivation:

The long term health and stability of FRAX will, in part, require proper management of the underlying collateral pool. Portfolio management to preserve and grow assets as well as generate predictable income is incredibly difficult on-chain. There are relatively few diversifying assets available to digital investors and diversification is the cornerstone of long term institutional portfolio management.

For decades, large investment managers (e.g. insurance companies and private equity et al.) have used Single Family Rental real estate in their broad portfolios for exactly the reasons FRAX should: to hold an uncorrelated, relatively low volatility, stable-income producing asset with positive expected returns.  PropFi is the first, and only, institutional-grade, real estate portfolio token and our product is aimed at assisting organizations exactly like FRAX.

The Genesis PropFi fund is a fully on-chain, portfolio of USA-located SFR real estate. The Genesis fund token represents a fractional claim on the underlying real estate fund allowing an investor access to ongoing exposure to net capital appreciation and net rental income - with target returns of 4%-6% pa net capital growth and 3%-4% pa net rental yield (for a target net total return of 7%-10% pa). Unlike other on-chain real estate products, we are building a geographically diversified portfolio of quality properties, in quality neighborhoods, with an emphasis on stable returns, predictable and resilient income, and liquidity.

The real estate for the genesis fund will be acquired, renovated, and managed by one of the top (and very few) institutional TradFi R.E. operating companies in the U.S. The founder of the OpCo is a partner and advisor to PropFi and brings 20 years of SFR investment experience having closed over $10B in acquisitions. His current firm, and our trusted partner, has $1B invested with $1.5B of dry powder from large insurance companies. The same quality portfolio available to large insurance companies and private equity firms will be offered through PropFi. Our portfolios will have no degradation of service, quality, partnership, returns, or economies of scale due to our growth stage that other institutions might impose on a startup.

Through our partners we have an extraordinary edge: We can tap into up to $125M per month of acquisition capacity (predicted to be $200M/mo in 2023). We can also tap into 200-250 simultaneous renovations.  We can access institutional portfolio insurance, with pricing based on our partner’s portfolio (worth north of $1B). We have financing available from TradFi bulge bracket banks normally reserved for much larger organizations. We have also secured an advisory relationship with the former Head of Risk of a $14B SFR fund. She will operate as our acting Head of Risk while we are launching.

On net, PropFi is offering a diversified institutional-grade SFR investment that competes with some of the best private equity REITs, with no minimum investment, and vastly greater liquidity - all fully frictionless and completely on-chain for organizations like FRAX.

FraxiG

Proposal

I'd like to propose the introduction of a [Ragequit] function for pools that pose no existential threat to Frax, if they were to unlock.

With some older pools having either dropped significantly in APY or the assets in the LP having become increasingly risky to hold, we're seeing an increasing number of people asking for unlocks or some way to get out of these ""dead"" and/or ""risky"" gauges.

The recent controversial discussions around the Temple/Frax LP pool being a perfect example. People have reached out to Temple team to figure out a solution. Temple currently came up with a migration of the LP's resulting in Temple taking over the locked LP's at a significant discount. This means value from Fraximalists flows to Temple treasury.

As long as those LP's stay locked the value doesn't necessarily leave the Frax ecosystem, however, if Temple ever decides to go for a Token swap this would warrant an unlock of the LP's and Temple can from that moment run off with the value extracted from the Frax eco.

This got me to thinking if there is not a better way to recycle this value and keep it in the Frax Eco. If we introduce an option for people to unlock their LP's, but make it so that unlocking incurs a cost (%slash) of said LP which ends up in the hands of Frax treasury, this could present a nice additional revenue source for the Frax Protocol. We could redistribute this value to veFXS holders to increase APR or whatever people can come up with, this can be discussed later.

This way instead of losing the value to the Temple treasury (for the example situation above), Frax could actually profit from it and increase their own.

If we could come up with a reasonable % for the slash I believe this could become a very useful function in which both The Unlockers and Frax Protocol ""win"". I do want to stress that this function, if introduced, should only be available for pools that are of either low TVL or have no significant risk to the protocol attached to it by unlocking.

Starting with a 20% fee on the temple/frax LP will be a good exercise to see how feasible it is.

Summary

Gearbox Protocol V2 has launched a few days ago, already attracting significant TVL [with

GEAR incentives as one of the supply distribution stages]. Frax should add Gearbox passive pool side to its AMO whitelist to deploy treasury assets for the LM event and continued yield generation.

GEAR that is earned as reward for passive LP mining should not be sold. Earned GEAR will be used for boosting/voting - when/if Gearbox DAO decides to implement tokenomics.

Initial max FRAX cap deployment should be $2M. Not all must be deployed immediately. Once the cap is hit, a new vote should be taken to determine if the cap should be raised.

PS: it's important to note that the active [leverage aka Credit Accounts] side of

Gearbox Protocol already has Frax3CRV and FraxUSDC integrated across Curve-yearn-Convex , meaning Gearbox DAO is already a friend of Frax DAO and supporting us from the start.

What is Gearbox?

Gearbox is a generalized leverage protocol. It has two sides to it: passive liquidity providers who earn low-risk APY by providing single-asset liquidity [that is the target of this [proposal]; and active farmers, firms, or even other protocols who borrow those assets to trade or farm with even x10 leverage.

Essentially, those farmers-borrowers are the protocol utilization that bring organic APYs to lenders next to GEAR emissions.

Gearbox Protocol allows anyone to take DeFi-native leverage and then use it across various (DeFi & more) protocols in a composable way.

You take leverage with Gearbox and then use it on other protocols you already love: Uniswap, Curve, Convex, Lido, etc.

For example, you can leverage trade on Uniswap, leverage farm on Yearn, make delta-neutral strategies, get Leverage-as-a-Service for your product, etc.

Some fresh helpful info:

Their V2 product/protocol update with code open [ medium article ]

Their Leverage Ninja guide, aka how composable leverage works [ medium article ]

General user docs [ gitbook link ]

Security and risks

Gearbox is founded by @0xmikko_eth [with @ivangbi as the shitposter] and has undergone several audits. Now, their protocol has no EAO admin signatures and is managed by a

DAO-enacted multisig with known founders in there 6/10 . More information on Audits, including their recent top-tier audits with

ChainSecurity, Sigma Prime, and Consensys Diligence - can be found here:

Audits & Bug Bounty .

As for the security of passive LP side, which is the topic of this proposal, it depends on several factors:

As with any lending protocol, third-party liquidations must work. They are open to anyone, here is more information in their docs with the link to the V2 liquidator bot anyone can copy and run.

Related to the point above, LTVs of assets and assets themselves need to be safe & sound. Gearbox DAO has recently voted for the new batch of V2 assets, and also has an engamenent with Risk DAO. Their LTVs for long-tail assets seem extremely safe, and the composition of farms [Curve-Convex-yearn-Lido] include only the safest of the protocols.

See those details here . So the common saying "" you are only as safe as your weakest link "" seems to be addressed here.

Step-by-Step

Just one step really:

In case this proposal goes through -> I have touched base with some Gearbox contributors, and confirmed that they have a plan to open a separate FRAX pool [ next to the current 5 passive pools ] - with some GEAR emissions into it. We would then simply need to supply FRAX into that pool then.

Interesting considerations for the future

Since Gearbox Protocol is doing so much with composability, it's possible that in the future some assets or contracts could not be desired by Frax DAO. In that case, we could ask for a separate Pool/Credit Manager setup whereas we would ask what risk we are comfortable with.

Modular !

Gearbox Protocol could become our avenue of integrations with other protocols, while isolating our risks and not having to build direct integrations. As such, we could increase the AMO cap as that FRAX liquidity would (a) bring revenues from leverage borrowers to Frax DAO (b) support FRAX liquidity across DeFi protocols as our APYs remain consistent and strong.

Voting

FOR: Authorize up to $2M FRAX for the Gearbox AMO to deposit treasury funds into. GEAR rewards will not be sold and will be kept for further protocol-to-protocol usage.

Against: Do nothing.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0x3b1509fd9347e5b409f2623a1ad84ae50b6a02da2bc7b69805c474ee3497ec32

Frax Core Developers

Summary

From the total PoS earnings approve 8% protocol fee for FXS holders & 2% of earnings as slashing/operating insurance fund.

Structure:

1.) Minimum of 90% of ETH earned rewarded to sfrxETH vault stakers in the form of frxETH

2.) 8% of earned ETH to Frax Protocol treasury in the form of frxETH. This ultimately will be distributed back to FXS holders.

3.) Slashing Insurance Fund: 2% goes into a fund to cover potential slashing events/unforeseen penalties to cover frxETH deposits to effectively keep frxETH overcollateralized at over 100% CR to cover any possible issues/losses.

NOTE: This structure will have to be modified once frxETH can support independently run validators in v2. There will have to be a validator-protocol split added to the structure. The current structure assumes that the Frax Protocol is the only entity running validators and thus the 8% fee covers the ""validator fee"" portion. This will not always be the case. For example, Lido's independent validators take a sizable portion of fees through the PoS yield and MEV/tips.

Background and Motivation

With the release of the frxETH liquid staking system, Frax Protocol now has a standalone system for issuing a liquid staking derivative, frxETH. This token is backed 1 to 1 by either liquid ETH or staked ETH in its entirety without any algorithmic or FXS backing. It is a fully collateralized staking derivative similar to stETH.

This proposal is to approve the initial fee structure of the system for frxETH version 1. The full Frax Ether documentation can be viewed here .

Background and Motivation

Fraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Any token part of a Chainlink data feed can be lent to borrowers or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.

Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

Summary

Deploy an FXS gauge for Convex wrapped position of frxETH-ETH Curve pool LP .

Curve pool address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1F8A6807c402E4A15ef4EBa36528A3FED24E577

Background and Motivation

The time has finally come for the release of frxETH and the Curve pool that will become the main source of liquidity for frxETH<>ETH swaps until withdrawals are open.

This proposal is noteworthy because it is the first proposal for a gauge that does not include the FRAX stablecoin. The requirement of FRAX needing to be in the deposit position of a gauge has been in effect since day 1. However, this proposal seeks to create the first exemption by proposing to have a gauge of frxETH-ETH LP as the ultimate deposit asset. I think this is a good use case of FXS emissions in the gauges and worthy of being the only exception in the Frax gauge system. The frxETH liquid staking system will be a cornerstone of the greater Frax economy and an important piece of financial infrastructure deserving of FXS emissions.

Problems Facing Token-Investor Relations:

Data in the cryptocurrency space is fragmented, and existing platforms often paint token issuers in an inaccurate and unflattering light. Public companies get to provide context and clarity in their quarterly reports and IR dashboards, why shouldn’t tokens?

In a market full of noise, it is difficult for many tokens to figure out which institutions matter and how to reach them

In a cyclical, narrative driven, and fast moving market, important updates and top projects are often overlooked as investors constantly chase hype and ignore substance.

Plan of Action & Deliverables:

Bespoke Metric Dashboard (Images are Stand-Ins)

Verified Supply Schedule

In Depth Asset Coverage

Corporate Access via Messenger, Calendar Integration for Investors to book meetings directly with FRAX representatives, Annual Virtual Roadshow.

Public Coverage - Asset verification report published on The Tie’s blog breaking down token, differentiators, token-economic model, and opportunities. Combination effort between Flywheelpod and Jack, who has extensive experience writing about and translating FRAX for institutional investors.

Two seats to the The Tie Terminal to facilitate two-way connectivity with the 150+ funds using the platform (Normally priced at $12k/year). To be allocated by Flywheelpod with input from the FRAX team, until FRAX core protocol builds out an official marketing team.

Integrate UniV3staker and add gauge for UniV3 FXS/FRAX

Background & Motivation

Adding gauges for Uniswap V3 FXS/FRAX positions

Abstract

Uni V3 LP offer higher capital efficiency and ability for market makers to provide tight markets for traders.

Currently there is 3.3m liquidity for the FXS/FRAX LP on Uniswap V3. This is POL liquidity provided by the team. It is used as the price for Coingecko and other aggregators. Additionally its used to provide prices to Chainlink.

Fraxswap is important because it allows for TWAMM orders. Adding UniV3 LP incentives will improve arbitragers ability to fill those orders and keep markets tight.

Adding gauges for these two pools will require addition of UniV3Staker ( https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-staker ). This will allow the protocol to pay out gauge rewards only to stakers who are in range.

Because of the need to rebalance and rotate on Uni V3 LP, locking bonuses should not be added. LPs should be able to unstake and adjust positions as needed.

Background

With the introduction of Temple’s STAX product and Convex entering the veFXS wars, Temple now has a vault with Convex Finance and utilizes Convex’s veFXS to get boosted FXS rewards.

Summary

The objective of this proposal is to authorize a $150k FRAX maximum donation to the next Gitcoin round at the discretion of the team.

Background and Motivation

Gitcoin is where the world’s leading web3 projects are born, validated & funded. This includes @

Uniswap , @ poapxyz & @

BanklessHQ , just to name a few!

Gitcoin Grants allows individuals to get funding for a public goods project they are working on. It leverages Quadratic Funding (QF) to allocate extra funding from a matching pool to the most impactful projects based on the number of contributors. And this ensures that projects doing the most significant public good get the most support.

The latest Gitcoin Grants Round (GR15) featured three types of rounds:

Main Round with $500k in matching funds

13 Ecosystem Rounds with a total of over $1.3 million in matching funds

Four Cause Rounds with a total of $1M in matching funds (Climate Solutions, Crypto Advocacy, DeSci, DEI)

It was supported by multiple matching sponsors such as

Vitalik Buterin ,

Aave ,

Yearn ,

Polygon ,

ENS ,

Chainlink , and

1inch .

We believe our industry aims toward a paradigm in which smart contracts are the predominant type of digital agreement, which depends heavily on open-source contributions. Therefore, supporting open-source development is, in our opinion, an essential duty, particularly if blockchain infrastructure is to maintain its value as a vitally important public asset that benefits everyone.

Fraxlend is the newest product of Frax Finance. It is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Any token part of a Chainlink data feed can be lent to borrowers or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This platform will open new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.

Automated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Aave and Rari platforms.

Creating a Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.

In the future, other Fraxlend pairs, along with the selected max authorized budget, can be added to Fraxlend AMO through a governance vote.

Proposal

For: Create a Fraxlend AMO and authorize up to $5m worth of liquidity for each of the mentioned Fraxlend pairs.

Proposal

Background & Motivation

Continuing the push to incentivize FraxBP pools, this proposal will add gauges for Convex wrapped positions of the following pools. (Similar to FIP 97 - Initial FRAXBP Metapool Gauges)

Abstract

Add a FXS gauge for the following Convex pools: pUSD/FraxBP

Mai/FraxBP

The staking token is a wrapped Convex staking position represented by an erc-20 that receives CRV and CVX rewards. This token can then be staked on a Frax Finance gauge to then also receive FXS rewards.

The wrapped staking position itself is an unmanaged trustless position and can be found on the Convex github at https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapperFrax.sol

Voting

For: Add the listed pools to FXS gauge controller as staked Convex positions

We propose to develop DeFi risk models and build summary risk dashboards quantifying Frax risk exposures and measures. While there are a few dashboards on activity and summary analytics of Frax, there are currently no risk models or risk frameworks that exist for any stablecoin, anywhere. These models and frameworks we propose to create will quantify all the various risk exposures so they can be properly identified, managed, and mitigated and open source to give further validation and confidence in Frax.

Overview

We will develop comprehensive beginning to end construction, tooling, and ongoing risk modeling for the Frax ecosystem, setting the standard for other stablecoins, and drastically reducing emerging regulatory risk exposure.

The skills and backgrounds necessary to build proper DeFi risk models and risk management framework requires the intersection of many fields including: financial risk modeling, on-chain analytics, technology development, treasury function including asset liability duration management, economic capital modeling and capital risk bucketing, liquidity risk identification and modeling, scenario analysis and stress testing, investment and collateral risk, monte carlo simulation, and sentiment analysis. The team has extensive experience in all of these areas and is best in class in the intersection of financial risk management and blockchain technology development.

Here is a first phase implementation of the

Liquidity Risk Dashboard . This dashboard operates purely against api.frax.finance and eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io and can be hosted from Docker containers running anywhere at the discretion of Frax governance.

Functional Collateralization Risk Dashboard Metrics

The Frax dashboard summarizes the collateralization metrics and runs a VaR model which estimates the probability of Frax being able to fully meet its liabilities at any point in time for any forward looking horizon.

The initial implementation uses simple stress tests which quantify if there is less than a 1% chance of Frax able to fully meet its liability over a 1 and 3 month time horizons assuming no changes in liability or collateral ratio (which are big assumptions) but can be refined by incorporating a scenario analysis framework in the future. Some of the key risk measures are the overall Frax Collateralization, the Max % Safe Price drop of FXS, and the VaR stress tests which quantify a 99% confidence for the maximum likely price drop of FXS to meet all Frax liabilities over a set time horizon. For these measures, FXS market cap would cover the non-collateralized portion of Frax as part of Overall Frax collateralization.

This sort of risk modeling framework can help guide decisions for the protocol and manage and monitor risk exposures. As an example, it could help determine the Required Collateral Ratio by setting risk tolerance limits and having a data driven approach to strategic decisions and managing overall risk exposures depending on market conditions and risk premia. This is especially important in Crypto given the incredibly high volatility, and the recent blowups of other stable coin chains and protocols which were not implementing proper risk modeling and management. The urgency of implementing sound risk modeling frameworks across DeFi protocols is critical.

This is only a proof of concept dashboard just for collateralization. Our proposed risk dashboards would include many more risk models and measures.

Proposed Engagement Activities and Services

We propose to develop custom risk models and summary risk dashboards for Frax. These will quantify and model various risk exposures to allow for management and risk mitigation.

A summary of the risk dashboards and example metrics along with detailed descriptions follows. These measures are quantified as point in time with customizable lookbacks (1hr, 1day, 1w, 1mo, 1q etc.) where appropriate, and will provide time series charting for the metrics. All the reports and dashboards will be designed to be persistent with little to no ongoing maintenance and allow user customization and risk reporting. Additional requested risk measures can be added interactively as requested.

Detailed Risk Dashboards & Example Risk Metrics

Liquidity Risk Profile Dashboard

LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) 1day, 1w, 1mo etc.

LVaR (Liquidity-adjusted VaR)

Quick and Current Ratios, capital position and collateral ratios

Proposal:

Due to the recent downfall of the EURO against the USD, the agEUR/Frax LP has become severely imbalanced. As of this writing the pool consists of 99%+ agEUR.

This means that in the current state the pool is a net loss to the protocol as it currently provides near to no liquidity for FRAX whilst still earning emissions from the gauge votes.

I propose that we deprecate/unlock the current gauge LP and redeploy it with updated ranges as a agEUR/FraxBP v2 metapool.

Doing this would reestablish liquidity between agEUR and FRAX and will also result in an increase of the FRAX supply.

They admit guilt for the hack by repaying the smaller victims but refuse to pay back FRAX and other DAOs even though the funds are there. They would rather pocket it to TRIBE holders, and this is not acceptable because: a. we were early investors, helped them bootstrap and took a very large risk, and b. we are a DAO, just like them, building DeFi for the common people.

Summary

Deploy a FRAX-SDL Fraxswap gauge to the gauge controller.

Background and Motivation

Saddle.finance is a solidity implementation stableswap DEX similar to Curve. Saddle has launched many of their base pools with FRAX included as the stablecoin. They have also launched a Saddle version of FRAXBP on their Ethereum pools with plans to expand this offering. FRAX has also deployed a significant amount of POL to these pools to earn SDL and become the base routing liquidity+lock veSDL.

Currently Saddle has only an ETH-SDL Sushiswap pool for their governance token. It would be a great idea to deploy a FRAX-SDL Fraxswap pool+gauge for Saddle to capture a majority of the SDL trading and allow Saddle to create pitch/bribe incentives for gauge voters.

Allocation of up to $5K for creating one educational video by DeFi Teller.

Proposal:

Frax Finance is a unique project and undoubtedly one of the key players in DeFi but surprisingly, we have not found quality and detailed videos about the technologies used in the protocol. We will be happy to fill this gap.

Since the protocol is quite complex in its design, and its core concepts are not easy to grasp for newcomers to the field, we propose to make a video explainer about the technological aspects of Frax Finance, its key ecosystem components describing in simple words its innovative hybrid stablecoin design and the logic behind it. Specifically, how the platform maintains the FRAX peg to the U.S. dollar through a dual collateral-backed and algorithmic mechanism, get into the arbitrage-based minting and redemption process, the FXS token utility and so forth. We’ll also cover the AMOs and explain their modular design and much more.

Who we are:

DeFi Teller is an educational resource that does the due diligence for the user by providing information about blockchain technology and decentralized applications (reviews, video explainers, on-chain data) in the most accessible way.

What we are good at:

Writing scripts targeted at an audience with an average level of knowledge in blockchain. We target people who have a basic understanding of how blockchain works, as well as a cursory understanding of the crypto market and its key players. Our viewer has probably already used dApps on the simple purchasing/trading/borrowing/staking level. Our task is to immerse this user deeper and explain in simple words what technology stands behind a particular project. In doing so, we take the presentation format very seriously and try to dig deep, figuring out what is under the hood of technologies and projects and what exactly makes them special. For example, this is how we explained what rollups are: https://youtu.be/XvSjNxZbThk

Creating distinctive visuals. The DeFi Teller team uses only original illustrations and takes a thoughtful approach to the process of video storyboarding. Our team of illustrators and animators works tightly with the editorial team, and the team of the project we're reviewing.

Process:

The existing DeFi Teller videos were created by us with our own funds and were highly praised by the teams of the projects we were talking about. For example, the Polkadot video was added to the welcome pages of the Polkadot and Kusama documentation. Further, we see our development in line with the spirit of decentralization - we would like to continue to talk about the most interesting DeFi projects and do so with nice graphics and quality scripts. We're not looking for profits coming directly from the teams, nor are we looking to create entirely commercial videos, reserving the right to choose the topics and angle of their coverage. All we need is to cover the cost of the video and support us in distributing the content (retweets, adding to documentation, and so forth).

The video creation process is as follows: -Writing script; -Creating storyboard; -Recording voice-over; -Animating the video; -Publishing the video on DeFi Teller resources ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4siZvLkAyiexFyPst1fC7w ;

Defiteller.guru , twitter.com/defiteller ).

Comments, remarks and suggestions from the team are more than welcome at all stages of the video production.

Timeline:

The timeline of the video depends on its budget. Without expanding the design team, and given that edits and comments from the team will be provided promptly, we can produce one video in about 3-4 weeks.

We will need

1 week to create and edit the script (two editors involved, 4hours a day each);

1 week for designing the storyboard (three design team members involved, 3-4 hours a day each);

1-2 weeks for the animation (two design team members involved, 5 hours a day each).

This is a preliminary estimate, the final estimate depends heavily on the script.

Budget:

Our team will be able to give you an accurate estimate of the budget only after the script is approved, since most of the cost of the video falls on the work of the illustrators and animators. A rough estimate is that on average one minute of video costs us $1,000. and For one video, we are looking at an allocation of up to $5K. The approximate cost of the final amount in percentage ratio looks like this:

Script

Writer - 5%

Editor - 7%

Storyboard

Illustrator - 25%

Designer - 16%

Supervisor - 7%

Animation

Designer - 30%

Frax Core Team

Summary

Commit Frax DAO to select proof of stake Ethereum mainnet (PoSETH) after the merge in place of any proof of work alternative fork (ETHPoW).

Background

Much controversy has been made over what might happen if there is a contentious hard fork at the ETH merge between a proof of work ETH chain and the newly created merged proof of stake ETH mainnet.

While the Frax core team understands the chance of any kind of contentious or viable ETHPoW chain is near 0% or single digit percent probability at best, it is useful for market participants that the Frax DAO signals which choice of fork is its preference unambiguously if there is one. As of writing, the only potential possibility of a viable fork is some form(s) of proof of work ETH alternative that does not merge the beacon chain with the geth execution clients thus keeping just the execution layer and proof of work consensus in place.

FRAX is the 5th largest stablecoin in the world and 20%+ of Curve's TVL, a Uniswap top 10 token, and a critical piece of the Ethereum ecosystem. Thus, it makes sense to clearly make FXS holders' desire public knowledge through governance. It has been claimed that prominent fiat stablecoins such as Tether and USDC will only accept redemptions on PoSETH: https://blockworks.co/stablecoins-will-only-have-value-on-pos-ethereum-post-merge/ . It would also be useful for FRAX to signal the same and have Frax DAO commit to capturing all significant value on ETHPoW, should it exist, and bring it to PoS ETH for FRAX redemptions making PoS ETH the canonical fork choice of all possible ETH forks post-merge.

Proposal

If there is significant value Frax DAO controls on  ETHPoW chain(s) (should any exist) then the core team will attempt to convert all assets on ETHPoW into ETH on PoSETH then deposit it into the DAO treasury msig as protocol controlled value to honor FRAX redemptions and increase the CR.

For:

Support FRAX redemptions only on PoSETH and sell any significant value the protocol controls on ETHPoW into ETH and transfer to PoSETH protocol treasury.

Frax Core Team

Summary

Remove all swaps for canFRAX and canFXS from any bridge. Deprecate support for any wrapped representation of FRAX+FXS on any other chain leaving only natively issued FRAX+FXS on Ethereum mainnet.

Background

Frax Finance pioneered the ""canonical stablecoin"" token architecture released in 2021 for canonical FRAX and canonical FXS . This allows each chain such as Moonbeam, Fantom, Polygon etc to have a native canFRAX ERC20 token contract which both the protocol and supported bridges can swap 1 to 1 between (up to certain limits).

For example, the canFRAX ERC20 contract on Polygon allows multiple different bridges to create canFRAX stablecoins by depositing 1 to 1 wrapped FRAX tokens representing bridged FRAX from Ethereum mainnet. If a user bridges 100 FRAX from Multichain to Polygon, they can deposit the 100 Multichain wrapped FRAX token to swap for 100 canFRAX on Polygon. If another user bridges 500 FRAX through the official Polygon bridge, they too can also bring their 500 wrapped FRAX and swap it for 500 canFRAX as well (minus swap fees). All AMMs, lending protocols, and AMOs use canFRAX of their respective chain so liquidity is not fragmented and 1 single address for FRAX becomes canonical per chain. This has very powerful network effects to make 1 FRAX token the default stablecoin rather than multiple kinds of bridged FRAX each with low liquidity and use cases.

MakerDAO recently announced they are releasing a similar feature (oddly named the exact same as canFRAX called canDAI): https://medium.com/bankless-dao/canonical-dai-stablecoin-upgrade-aims-to-help-move-dai-off-chain-2a8de6a815c1

This proves that the canonical stablecoin architecture is the best way for a stablecoin to grow on other chains and build a network effect around a single token address.

However, there is one specific problem with the canonical stablecoin system: the bridge tokens that are swapped 1 to 1 for canFRAX are held within the protocol's ownership and thus expose the risk of multiple bridges. Additionally, a single bridge being hacked removes liquidity for canFRAX users since some of them won't be able to swap back to Ethereum (the native home for the Frax protocol and all FRAX, FXS, FPI, FPIS tokens) due to part of the liquidity being worth $0 . We saw this occur with the Harmony 1Bridge hack where some canFRAX on Harmony is now stranded without the ability to bridge that amount of canFRAX back to Ethereum. This is also currently happening with canFRAX on Moonbeam as we speak due to the Nomad bridge hack. Essentially, the current structure of canFRAX is that it is not technically a native liability of the Frax protocol but simply a pooled representation of of all bridged versions of FRAX on the destination chain that diversifies the bridge risk but does not remove it. This is why when a bridge is hacked like Nomad or Harmony, users of canFRAX are rightfully concerned what happens to their canFRAX stablecoins on their chain since the backing of those canFRAX has significantly taken a hit.

This governance proposal aims to change the above structure and remove bridge swaps between canFRAX+canFXS stablecoins. This means that if you hold canFRAX on any chain, it is fully backed by the Frax protocol's value and collateral on Ethereum mainnet and the CR is correctly displayed for all canFRAX and Ethereum mainnet FRAX combined. However, in order for you to be able to bridge canFRAX and canFXS back to Ethereum, there will need to be liquidity providers in Curve pools, Fraxswap, other AMMs that pair wrapped bridge tokens such as anyFRAX with canFRAX creating swap pools. This means the risk of bridge hacks and bridge risk is entirely offloaded to LPs of these bridge pools that pair canFRAX with different wrapped versions of FRAX bridged from Ethereum. For example, in order to exit your canFRAX on Fantom through the Multichain bridge to Ethereum, there must be a Curve pool that has liquidity between anyFRAX-canFRAX so that a user swaps for anyFRAX, then uses that to return to Ethereum. Bridge partners can apply for FXS gauge pools for these ""bridge liquidity pools"" but the protocol will no longer support them with POL or 1 to 1 swappers for canFRAX or canFXS.

Count-intuitively, should this proposal pass, it could make canFRAX one of the safest assets on non-ETH chains because it has the full faith and commitment to redeem against FRAX on Ethereum L1 while having 0 bridge risk. Chains that use a specific bridge as the predominant way to bring all tokens to their chain such as Fantom using Multichain bridged assets or Moonbeam using Nomad assets means that if those bridges are hacked, almost all tokens are worthless on their entire network except for canFRAX or canFXS. Hypothetically if Multichain was hacked, then USDC, USDT, ETH, WBTC, and almost all other tokens would be worth 0 on Fantom since all liquidity pools and projects use the wrapped bridge version of those tokens through Multichain. Fantom has almost no natively issued blue chip tokens other than FTM itself.

In the above example, canFRAX would still retain its full peg and value regardless of any other bridge risk or what any chain uses as their main bridge since canFRAX holders would not be at all exposed to any kind of bridged asset whatsoever. Put in another way, there could be situations where every asset on another chain is worthless other than canFRAX and their L1 token if this governance proposal passes.

Proposal

Remove all swaps from canFRAX and canFXS on all chains with their supported bridges. Remove all protocol owned liquidity and all protocol ownership of wrapped bridge FRAX & bridged FXS on every chain.

For:

Deprecate all 1 to 1 swaps between canFRAX & canFXS in their respective contracts on all chains. Remove all protocol owned wrapped/bridged FRAX+FXS from balance sheet.

Proposal

We propose to develop DeFi risk models and build summary risk dashboards quantifying Frax risk exposures and measures. While there are a few dashboards on activity and summary analytics of Frax, there are currently no risk models or risk frameworks that exist for any stablecoin, anywhere. These models and frameworks we propose to create will quantify all the various risk exposures so they can be properly identified, managed, and mitigated and open source to give further validation and confidence in Frax.

The analysis and on-chain risk modeling will be implemented with Credmark protocol. Credmark is a full stack Defi financial modeling platform that runs natively in Python which allows us to move beyond simple analytics and develop sophisticated forward looking financial risk models. We run our own database of indexed Ethereum data, python based dev-tooling, and cloud infrastructure for building and executing complex financial models. This enables DAOs and financial institutions to use comprehensive and accurate on-chain financial metrics.

The Credmark team has published numerous research reports including a detailed post-mortem of the Terra ecosystem collapse Additionally, Debt DAO leverages Credmark’s technology and expertise in order to evaluate counterparties cash flow and treasury in order to determine appropriate loan terms. One such loan proposal was recently passed by the Frax community via governance vote.

Overview

We will develop comprehensive beginning to end construction, tooling, and ongoing risk modeling for the Frax ecosystem, setting the standard for other stablecoins, and drastically reducing emerging regulatory risk exposure.

The skills and backgrounds necessary to build proper DeFi risk models and risk management framework requires the intersection of many fields including: financial risk modeling, on-chain analytics, technology development, treasury function including asset liability duration management, economic capital modeling and capital risk bucketing, liquidity risk identification and modeling, scenario analysis and stress testing, investment and collateral risk, monte carlo simulation, and sentiment analysis. The team has extensive experience in all of these areas and is best in class in the intersection of financial risk management and blockchain technology development.

Here is an example Frax analytics and trading dashboard recently completed with Credmark:

Example (Frax/FXS/FPIS distribution and inflows/outflows).

Functional Collateralization Risk Dashboard Metrics

The Frax Collateralization Metrics uses Credmark on-chain data and risk modeling framework. The dashboard below summarizes the collateralization metrics and runs a VaR model which estimates the probability of Frax being able to fully meet its liabilities at any point in time for any forward looking horizon.

The initial implementation also uses simple stress tests which quantify if there is less than a 1% chance of Frax able to fully meet its liability over a 1 and 3 month time horizons assuming no changes in liability or collateral ratio (which are big assumptions) but can be refined by incorporating a scenario analysis framework in the future. Some of the key risk measures are the overall Frax Collateralization, the Max % Safe Price drop of FXS, and the VaR stress tests which quantify a 99% confidence for the maximum likely price drop of FXS to meet all Frax liabilities over a set time horizon. For these measures, FXS market cap would cover the non-collateralized portion of Frax as part of Overall Frax collateralization. As below the 90day Horizon stress test fails because the VaR of -88% is greater than the max Safe Price drop of -76.6%.

As a comparison and validation, the collateralization metrics and VaR models as of Apr 20, 2022 (before the Terra UST collapse) are detailed below to determine how the risk exposures have changed.

As can be seen from the collateralization metrics comparing July to April, there was a significant deterioration in the Overall Frax Collateralization from 175% to 124%, and the Frax treasury as well which was dominated by FXS. The other change is the decrease in Max % Safe Price drop of FXS from 85% to 76%, and the massive increase in VaR in July driven by the 85% price drop of FXS from April into May. In response the collateral ratio was also increased.

In summary overall risk exposures have increased, although Frax is still in a very healthy risk position with many levers to manage risk.

Another potential area of further risk analysis is the high Beta of FXS relative to the Frax market cap (overall liability) and the high percentage of Frax treasury dominated in FXS. The overall Frax market capitalization declined from $2.6b to $1.4b which is almost a 50% drop, yet the FXS price declined from $35 to $6 which is about an 80% drop, indicating a Beta of around 1.6.

As part of a contingency funding plan framework for market stress scenarios that might be needed to cover the liability, diversifying some portion of treasury into other assets that are not correlated to the Frax liability (market cap) would strengthen the overall risk profile of Frax if it’s ever needed to intervene during times of market stress.

This sort of risk modeling framework can help guide decisions for the protocol and manage and monitor risk exposures. As an example, it could help determine the Required Collateral Ratio by setting risk tolerance limits and having a data driven approach to strategic decisions and managing overall risk exposures depending on market conditions and risk premia. This is especially important in Crypto given the incredibly high volatility, and the recent blowups of other stable coin chains and protocols which were not implementing proper risk modeling and management. The urgency of implementing sound risk modeling frameworks across DeFi protocols is critical.

This is only a proof of concept dashboard just for collateralization. Our proposed risk dashboards would include many more risk models and measures.

Proposed Engagement Activities and Services

We propose to develop custom risk models and summary risk dashboards for Frax. These will quantify and model various risk exposures to allow for management and risk mitigation.

A summary of the risk dashboards and example metrics along with detailed descriptions follows. These measures are quantified as point in time with customizable lookbacks (1hr, 1day, 1w, 1mo, 1q etc.) where appropriate, and will provide time series charting for the metrics. All the reports and dashboards will be designed to be persistent with little to no ongoing maintenance and allow user customization and risk reporting. Additional requested risk measures can be added interactively as requested.

Proposal

Grant $60,000 of FXS and FRAX (split 50/50) for a 6 month period in order to fund Flywheel which will continue its efforts producing content covering the Frax ecosystem. In addition, we intend to continue to host meetups IRL as well under the “Fraximalist” Brand. In return, we will have FRAX sponsor our long-form content and advertise primitives such as Fraxswap, Fraxlend, FPI, and FrxETH.

Background

Over the past 3 months, Flywheel has made incredible strides for producing content for the Frax ecosystem and has been able to expand Frax’s media footprint online, executing on its goals laid out in the original Podcast & Media grant of taking control of its own narrative as well as educating the wider community.

Flywheel Output

Since Flywheel launched 3 months ago we have:

Over 430 subscribers on YouTube

Over 900 followers on Twitter

Produced two episodes with over 1000 views

Created 3 different series including Flywheel Pod, Fraxcast, and StableClaire Explains

Fund institutional-level pieces of Frax in the Flywheel substack.

These numbers show the incredible traction that Flywheel has received. The response to Flywheel has been overwhelmingly positive by both people in and outside the Frax community who are hungry for quality content. This is important because there is noticeably a media vacuum in crypto that has not kept up with the sheer speed of segmentation happening in Web3 as a whole. Flywheel is carving out its corner of the media space through covering and making sense of the Frax ecosystem through interviews, commentary, and explainers.

In the future, we want to continue producing Flywheel content and will use these funds to cover expenses and labor hours spent prepping, recording, editing, and distributing content. You can keep up with Flywheel on

Twitter ,

Telegram ,

YouTube ,

Spotify , and

Apple . Specifically, this grant will help fund:

A consistent stream of content related to the Frax ecosystem including:

Our flagship podcast, Flywheel, which brings on members of the community and protocol partners to discuss the latest developments in Frax, DeFi, stablecoins, and everything in between. We have been releasing one episode a week since launch and will keep going at that pace.

In addition, we plan on continuing to release other content such as Fraxcast which is general commentary about the Frax ecosystem and StableClaire Explains... which covers the basics of understanding stablecoins and Frax. We intend to release this content on a more consistent basis.

Advertisements for Frax primitives

Frax has recently released or is releasing a host of novel DeFi primitives including Fraxswap, Fraxlend, FPI, and FrxETH. Although people in the Frax community may be aware of them, there are many who are not. With these advertisements, we intend to further entrench the mutually symbiotic relationship between Frax and Flywheel by educating viewers about these primitives in short adverts.

The people who are leading this initiative include:

Sam McCulloch ( @ssmccul ) who is a long-time member of the Frax community and has had a podcast of his own. Sam will be the lead and producer for the unit and will act as producer to both shows as well as co-host the Frax Town Square.

DeFi Dave ( @davesaidthat_ ) who is a Day Zero Fraximalist and has hosted a podcast in the past, The DeFi Scoop. He will co-host both Flywheel and Frax Town Square. kapital_k (

0xkapital_k ) who is a DeFi/Gaming/Tokenomics enthusiast and Frax supporter who has researched the protocol deeply.

In the previous three months, expenses have primarily incurred from production of Flywheel. For those who are curious of how the Treasury has been utilized, you can see a breakdown of it here . It is important to note that DeFi Dave and kapital_k have not taken any compensation for their efforts choosing instead to reinvest in building up Flywheel. In addition, PIF Labs has been aiding in commissioning the institutional-level writing content for Flywheel.

Fraximalist Meetups

Fraximalist meetups are IRL gatherings of enthusiasts and curious alike and so far, three of them have taken place in Amsterdam (during Devconnect), New York (during NFT NYC), and (Paris during EthCC). The latest one in Paris attracted nearly 30 attendees who listened to DeFi Dave’s speech as well as stuck around for a merch giveaway.

In the future, Fraximalist meetups can host panels, discussions, and bring together thinkers & active players alike from across DeFi. Several conferences that Fraximalists meetups can take place at in the near future include:

MCON Sept 6-9

Messari Mainnet Sept 21-23

DevCon Oct 11-14

ETH Lisbon Oct 28-30

The goals of curating events are to create a sense of community, cultivate substantive discussion, and represent the protocol IRL. As part of Flywheel’s outreach efforts on behalf of Frax, organizing these meetups is an essential component of the marketing stack to increase awareness of Frax.

Funds from this grant will help cover the costs associated with hosting events including securing physical locations, setting up props, having food/water/amenities, as well as labor hours setting up and executing events.

DeFi Dave has been and will continue to lead the Fraximalist meetup series.

Motivation

Flywheel aims to be the “Bankless of Frax” and take the wheel in driving both Frax’s and the automated stablecoin narrative forward. There is simply just too much at stake to do nothing and merely “hope for the best”, we need to keep actively engaging the wider DeFi community and beyond in order to inform, educate, and entertain them about Frax and its surrounding ecosystem. We strongly believe that Frax will reach Ethereum-level in size and along the way, Frax can not only scale technologically on-chain, but must scale socially off-chain as well.

Flywheel has done an excellent job representing Frax so far and we are here to keep pushing the momentum forward. As mentioned in the last proposal, the Frax ecosystem is growing to become much bigger than the core team alone and numerous contributors and commentators have arisen that have helped advance the protocol. Flywheel is here to organize and shine a light on Frax, carrying the Fraximalist torch up high for those who seek it.

Breakdown of the sponsorship/grant

Total cost: $60k (half $FRAX/half $FXS)

Podcast(s) Budget

52 episodes over the span of 6 months with Frax-related ad of Fraxswap and other Frax primitives when released

Cost per episode $1000, totaling $52k.

Contracted Content Budget $2000 total for video explainers about Frax and stablecoins directed towards a novice audience

Add the Arable arUSD Stability Fund to the Gauge System

Background and Motivation

Benefits for FRAX Holders

ACRE airdrop to everyone who participates in the voting process upon successful passing of the proposal as a good-faith partnership action.

ACRE rewards for participants in the Arable arUSD Stability Fund.

This partnership between Arable and the FRAX community will lead to increased visibility of each other’s communities.

The Protocol

Arable Protocol is a DeFi platform that focuses on synthetic farming and trading. Our objective is to make multi-chain farming accessible, affordable, and simple for everyone. Both seasoned and novice farmers can easily stake yield farms from various chains thanks to a user interface that is straightforward but effective. Arable Protocol is based around a synthetic ecosystem and its liquidity is created through the minting of the stable asset arUSD. Users can exchange between different LP tokens and synthetic cryptocurrencies using arUSD, and they can farm on synthetic yield farms that follow the APR of their native chain counterparts.

The Stability Fund

The Arable arUSD Stability Fund is a multi-token contract that allows swapping between multiple stable assets, including arUSD, FRAX, and other stablecoins like USDT and USDC. All participants in the Arable arUSD Stability Fund earn extra ACRE rewards as an incentive.

The Stability Fund is an unbalanced pool, meaning you do not need to deposit a combination of tokens of equal value as is common with Uniswap-style contracts. Any desired amount of a supported stablecoin can be deposited on its own.

During the arUSD Stability Pool’s operation, users will be able to swap between any stablecoins at a fixed ratio of 1:1 without any slippage. If at any time a side of the pool runs out of liquidity, only swaps into a stablecoin where liquidity is available are possible.

The arUSD stability pool will only be in operation for a limited time during the early launch phase of Arable MVP. Once the protocol reaches one million minted arUSD, public pools will go live on 3rd party DEXs. The arUSD stability pool contract will be used as a stability fund once the public pools are up and running to keep the price of the arUSD and the USD on parity and to buffer large buy and sell operations in the early phase of the protocol.

We propose to add the Arable arUSD Stability Fund, which includes FRAX, arUSD as well as other stablecoins like USDT, USDC and YUSD, to the Gauge System.

Proposal

Background & Motivation

Now that the FraxBP is live, protocols should feel welcomed to make metapools. Alongside incentives outlined in FIP-95, FraxBP metapools should, on top of their respective CRV gauges, also receive FXS gauges to further incentivize migration to the FraxBP family.

Abstract

As with previous FIPs 90 and 57, we propose that the following Curve pools receive a Convex wrapped position FXS gauge. sUSDFRAXBP

USDDFRAXBP

GUSDFRAXBP

TUSDFRAXBP alUSDFRAXBP

LUSDFRAXBP

BUSDFRAXBP apeUSDFRAXBP

The staking token is a wrapped Convex staking position represented by an erc-20 that receives CRV and CVX rewards. This token can then be staked on a Frax Finance gauge to then also receive FXS rewards.

The wrapped staking position itself is an unmanaged trustless position and can be found on the Convex github at https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/tree/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers

Summary

Deploy a FRAX-SDL Fraxswap gauge to the gauge controller.

Background and Motivation

Saddle.finance is a solidity implementation stableswap DEX similar to Curve. Saddle has launched many of their base pools with FRAX included as the stablecoin. They have also launched a Saddle version of FRAXBP on their Ethereum pools with plans to expand this offering. FRAX has also deployed a significant amount of POL to these pools to earn SDL and become the base routing liquidity+lock veSDL.

Currently Saddle has only an ETH-SDL Sushiswap pool for their governance token. It would be a great idea to deploy a FRAX-SDL Fraxswap pool+gauge for Saddle to capture a majority of the SDL trading and allow Saddle to create pitch/bribe incentives for gauge voters.

4 years locked.

Proposal

Use the “Project Treasury / Grants / partnerships / Security-Bug-Bounties” veFXS balance to farm incoming bribes and fund an airdrop for veFXS holders.

Background

When FRAX launched it allocated 5% of the FXS supply to the “Project Treasury / Grants / partnerships / Security-Bug-Bounties” fund.

Since then we have voted to lock most of this FXS in veFXS , see FIP-40 > https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth/proposal/0x9f2a821579795a658f6d0bd1e802221865a6c79dbac4e7310988cd8f62ccc432

Generally speaking this FXS remains locked in veFXS, only being removed once a month so a small amount of FXS can be removed to fund a selection of our monthly costs.

We currently have just over 4.1m FXS locked in veFXS and it can be tracked here. https://etherscan.io/address/0x9aa7db8e488ee3ffcc9cdfd4f2eaecc8abedcb48#tokentxns

Summary

The fund is being used to fund the projects needs but 99% of the time is just sitting in veFXS staking collecting a small amount of rewards.

Motivation

The 4.1m veFXS is offering us little to no value and can be used in a more capital efficient way while still fulfilling its role of funding grants, partnerships and security.

Right now 4.1m veFXS controls around 4.2% of the weekly gauge emissions if all veFXS voters vote.

Proposal In Detail

We allow the team to use these veFXS to vote on the FRAX gauge when they can earn bribes for there voting power.

We use the veFXS to collect bribes until we have collected $25m in total value or the veFXS amount in the wallet drops below 500k.

We then use this $25m to fund an airdrop to veFXS holders.

While the funds collected go from $0 to $25m the team can stake the funds collected to help us reach the $25m target faster.

Dennis (Frax Finance)

Proposal

Background & Motivation

Now that the FraxBP is live and the Frax Finance whitelist proposal will end soon ( https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/196 ). We would like to define how the FraxBP Protocol Owned Liquidity farming revenue will be handled as well as incentives for Frax and FraxBP related AMM pools.

Original Curve governance proposal can be found here: https://gov.curve.fi/t/deploy-a-fraxbp-pool-whitelist-frax-for-vecrv-staking/3958

Section 1: FraxBP Revenue

As stated by Sam of Frax in the Curve governance forums, Frax will move to be even more symbiotic with the Curve ecosystem. Up until now, CRV farmed was sold to FXS. This FXS was used for further incentives and/or platform revenue. Frax will now shift into a new strategic position with farmed rewards to eliminate this sell pressure while still allowing itself a means to utilize the token's value.

As Frax farms CRV and CVX emissions from FraxBP, Frax will:

Lock all CVX as vlCVX

Lock at least 5% of CRV as veCRV

Use remaining CRV to acquire(direct deposit or purchase at team discretion) cvxCRV

The cvxCRV can be used as voting incentives. The cvxCRV not used for incentives will be staked for revenue.

The veCRV rule is only a minimum.

The ratio of how much is locked, staked, or used as incentives is determined by the Frax team while looking at current market conditions.

This setup gives the Frax team a large leeway in how it can fund the FraxBP and hold on to what it can given the ever changing market conditions. Making sure the FraxBP is well funded is a higher priority than increasing treasury assets. The held treasury asset balances and types can be reassessed again at a later point once the ecosystem around FraxBP has grown and stabilized.

Section 2: Voting Incentives and Gauge Weight

Frax will continue providing voting incentives for Frax pools on the Votium platform. As described in the original Curve proposal, Frax will also strive to be an active partner for pools that decide to pair with the FraxBP by contributing to voting incentives for FraxBP metapools. In addition to this, with the enactment of the Curve whitelist proposal, any veCrv Frax locks can be used for promoting Frax pools or metapools on the Curve gauge system.

Voting Incentives:

Along with FXS allocation from treasury, Frax may also use a portion of cvxCRV farmed from the FraxBP for incentives on the Votium platform up to a maximum value of $10,000,000, as has been previously decided in a past governance proposal.

Frax will continue to provide voting incentives for Frax pools. However, with the advent of the base pool, Frax can now also provide incentives to FraxBP metapools.

For Ethereum Mainnet:

Metapools may receive a share of incentives based on organic TVL of the FraxBP in each pool. A maximum of 20% of yield from the FraxBP protocol owned liquidity may be applied to each metapool and 50% of such yield applied to all metapools in total. (Note: Organic TVL, TVL not affected by incentives or gauge weight from Frax, is determined by the Frax Team.)

For non-Ethereum chain pools:

The FraxBP for each chain may receive increased incentives based on the total TVL of FraxBP in all metapools on a given chain.

Non-Ethereum chain metapools are structured differently on Curve's crosschain implementations and thus already automatically earn the base yield of the base pool gauge weight proportionally. This is something Ethereum mainnet metapools do not do because of gas costs. Thus we will attempt to mimic such a concept on mainnet by adding voting incentives to mainnet metapools. However, keeping Protocol Owned Liquidity at a healthy level is also important thus, at max, half of the incentives from FraxBP revenue may be applied to metapools.

Frax veCRV Gauge Weight:

The Frax team will have discretion on how to effectively use veCRV gauge weight to promote Frax pools or metapools.

Voting

For:

Enact FraxBP farming and Frax pool voting incentive strategies described above.

Add an OlympusDAO OHM-FRAX gauge on Fraxswap with Mint and Sync (M&S).

Background & Motivation:

OlympusDAO is seeking to create a closer partnership with the Frax Finance community and ecosystem. Olympus had previously created deep liquidity with FRAX at a max depth of $17M, aided in Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) for Frax Finance through Olympus Pro (Total Bonded Value of +$5M) and current holds FRAX as Risk Free Value for the protocol ($33M in reserves). This partnership continued with a DAO swap (

OIP-53

Execute DAO Swap with Frax Finance 3) and the acceptance of Olympus being able to lock its FXS tokens (

FIP-38

Whitelist OlympusDAO to Stake veFXS 4).

Note: FRAX currently represents approximately 10% of Market Value of the Treasury and is considered a core reserve asset.

FIP-51 was posted so that Olympus’ LP would be whitelisted as a gauge. The proposal received feedback from the community to change the proposed LP from OHM-FRAX to gOHM-FRAX. This was suggested to make it easier for third party liquidity providers to receive FXS rewards. Olympus would like to propose an alternative option that not only incentivizes third party liquidity but it also will be the first pool receiving

M&S . M&S approved pools receive rebases directly into the LP.

OHM-FRAX with M&S on Fraxswap will be protected from emission dilution and allow for the ability for liquidity providers to receive FXS rewards. Olympus currently holds ~209k FXS and intends to vote on the gauge if approved. In the past 3 months gOHM has performed well against the market which suggests that an OHM-Stable pool with M&S should be an attractive LP. Therefore driving TVL and volume to Fraxswap as Olympus’ primary OHM-FRAX market. With passing governance approval Olympus will seed liquidity to kickstart the pool.

Benefits of this Gauge:

Community-provided liquidity receives rebases directly into the pool

Exposure to one of the best performing assets in the past 3 months

Community liquidity providers are able to receive a portion of Olympus’ veFXS vote

Fraxswap becomes Olympus’ primary FRAX market

LP + M&S + veFXS voting will help to drive more volume and TVL to Fraxswap

Summary

Deploy a FRAX-SYN Fraxswap gauge to the gauge controller.

Background and Motivation

Synapse Protocol is one of the emerging bridge projects that has had a good relationship with FRAX for quite some time. The team is professional, helpful, and has bridged synFRAX on multiple chains to date. Previously, FRAX did an Ondo.finance FRAX-SYN vault as a partnership between the two projects. On maturity, this vault had some bad debt on closing and thus Synapse paid in SYN per the terms of the Ondo.finance vault. Thus, FRAX protocol has a significant amount of SYN. We've been working in cooperation with the Synapse team to build positive value together so they can both repay their FRAX fixed term debt from the Ondo vault as well as get their SYN returned after FRAX denominated debt has been repaid. We've suggested that to build good liquidity onchain, we can propose a FRAX-SYN Fraxswap gauge to get FXS emissions toward this.

The Synapse team has also expressed a commitment to do SYN co-incentives for this gauge together. This helps both FRAX & Synapse in multiple ways: SYN gets deep stablecoin liquidity onchain, FRAX can deploy POL with the SYN that it currently has to earn SYN rewards, and both communities can LP to earn both FXS+SYN+fees. Additionally, the TWAMM functionality of Fraxswap can be used to slowly repay the FRAX debt over a reasonable period of time for Synapse Protocol, putting them on strong footing and creating a great partnership opportunity for both projects.

Summary

Deploy a FRAX-FPIS Fraxswap gauge to the gauge controller.

Background and Motivation

After the launch of the FPI stablecoin and expansion of FPI staking venues on Curve+Convex+FXS gauges, it's important to roll out utility and yield for FPIS (the governance token of the FPI stablecoin). One of the first places to do this is to get FPIS LPs yield in the FXS gauge system. The FPI protocol itself can also bribe/incentivize veFXS voters with FPIS to increase the FRAX-FPIS gauge weight and get a profitable yield (as well as deploy POL itself potentially). Thus, we propose the next step in FPIS utility be a new gauge pair preceding the launch of veFPIS.

It's important to note that for FXS gauges, the trading pair must be FRAX-FPIS instead of FPI-FPIS. Once veFPIS and associated emissions are released publicly in the coming weeks, the community+team can propose creating FPI trading pairs as well where applicable.

Add the Gamma FPI-FRAX 0.05% Uniswap v3 pool to FRAX gauges on Optimism

Background

Gamma is an active liquidity manager and market-making platform that is currently building on Uniswap v3. It has been managing liquidity on Uniswap v3 since the launch of Uniswap v3 and has undergone multiple audits with the most recent one completed by ConsenSys Diligence. Currently, Gamma is managing over 50 pairs on Mainnet, 9 pairs on Polygon, and 5 pairs on Optimism.

Motivation

The main advantage of adding a Frax gauge for the FPI-FRAX Uniswap v3 pool is to increase market coverage and trade volume for FPI and FRAX on Optimism. Uniswap currently has the majority market share of all trading volume on Optimism (as of 6/21/2022). The capital efficiency and breadth of assets on Uniswap will allow for efficient trades from ETH, WBTC, and exotic assets to FPI and vice versa. This combined with Uniswap’s top-of-mind awareness amongst traders and LPs ultimately allows for greater exposure to FPI.

The advantage of using Gamma to manage the FPI-FRAX pool is that it will manage the range to more tightly maintaining the peg to the CPI-U as indicated here

Bureau of Labor Statistics Data as well as generate profitable yield for LPs.

Unlike prior gauges for Uniswap v3 FRAX-USDC and Uniswap v3 FRAX-DAI, the gauge for FPI-FRAX will likely require active management due to the slowly drifting peg of FPI. For example, the current Uniswap V3 FRAX/USDC position was easier to make a gauge for because one could simply specify the min and max price at 0.995 and 1.005 respectively without ever having to change the ranges for the position. Because FPI will increase against FRAX over time, some active management of the position will be necessary.

Gamma is currently managing the rETH-THETA / ETH pair for Ribbon Finance, which similarly deals with an increase in rETH-THETA price against ETH of around 0.3% per week. Our algorithm dynamically tracks the price per share of rETH-THETA and manages the liquidity to maintain peg to the Net Asset Value of rETH-THETA. Similarly, we will track the value of the CPI and automatically manage the liquidity ranges to maintain peg to the CPI-U.

An added benefit of having a manager is that we will also compound fees that are collected outside of the LP position back into the LP position, further increasing the liquidity for FPI-FRAX.

FRAX/FPI Specs

Fee Tier: 0.05%

Position ranges: Maintain a +/- 5 tick distance from the current price as indicated by the CPI-U

Example if CPI-U price is 1 FRAX per FPI, then the lower range will be 0.9956 and the upper range will be 1.0056.

Gamma Specs

Gamma takes 10% of fees claimed to pay gas fees for rebalances

The position manager contract allows for limited admin functionality, namely with regards to rebalancing the position as the FPI drifts gradually upward. There are no functionality or admin rights to withdraw any liquidity.

Summary

Set new FXS gauge pools to a 1-year max lock limit with a max 2x time boost.

Background & Motivation

There have been recent discussions on how long the time lock for pools should be. Three years can be too long and discourage people to do the full lock. A reduction to one year would encourage a higher average lock term. Sam of the Frax team believes their modeling shows a one-year time limit with a max 2x time boost to be the most efficient.

Older pools are immutable and can not be changed. This would require migration if we want to change their time lock mechanics. This proposal, however, is for future gauges only and migrations will need to be dealt with in a different proposal

Summary

Add the new FRAX/USDC Curve pool as a wrapped Convex staking position to the Gauge Controller to increase liquidity via CRV, CVX, and FXS rewards.

Background & Motivation

With the recent deployment of the FraxBP (Frax/Usdc) pool, we should look at adding FXS incentives on top of the CRV and CVX rewards that the pool will receive.

Much like FIP-57(Frax/Fip gauge) we can use a wrapped staking position on Convex to create an erc20 token that receives CRV and CVX. This token can then be staked on a Frax Finance gauge to then also receive FXS rewards.

The wrapped staking position itself is an unmanaged trustless position and can be found on the Convex github at https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/tree/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers

Summary

Propose using 20m FRAX to buyback FXS using Fraxswap FRAX-FXS TWAMM pair over a period of minimum 3 days or up to 30+ days (exact period at core team's discretion).

Background and Motivation

Over the past month, the crypto markets have indisputably become bearish and prices have dropped anywhere between 40-90% for most major tokens. However, FXS has been particularly hard hit. FRAX's peg is indisputably resilient, has never been in doubt, and has held perfectly since inception. The protocol as a whole has been in excellent shape. Thus, the core team does not believe the significantly worse performance of FXS compared to other tokens is justified any longer and feels confident to propose a large $20m FXS buyback using the TWAMM should the community+token holders approve.

FRAX still makes over $80m annual revenue while FXS has dropped out of the top 100 Coingecko rankings. Thus, FXS seems to be the most undervalued out of all other volatile assets FRAX could hold on the balance sheet. At these prices, it is probable that using capital/profits to purchase FXS is the best use of capital dollar for dollar spent. It's important to highlight that this is not something that is often true. This is only the case when the community and core team believe that FXS is the most undervalued across all assets that the protocol can allocate capital to. For example, a $20m FXS buyback (and burn) at $4 FXS would retire 5% of the total supply of FXS. An incredible return of value to token holders at such prices. Such a scenario would effectively make the total supply of FXS less than 95m.

But at this time, we personally believe that to be the case. Thus, we are proposing this extensive buyback program. FRAX is strong and profitable enough to take advantage of the market irrationality on its governance token. While other protocols are liquidating volatile assets and their tokens for stablecoins, FRAX has a formidable warchest and cash flows that it can do the exact opposite and take advantage of this mispricing.

Should the proposal pass, the FXS bought back can be burned entirely, placed in veFXS yield, or retained in the treasury until future governance allocates uses. This specific proposal is simply for the clearance to initiate this $20m TWAMM FXS buyback.

Approve 20m FRAX to buyback FXS using Fraxswap TWAMM of 3 days or up to 30+ day period.

Summary:

This proposal is to whitelist STAX Finance in the Frax Finance VotingEscrow contract to allow STAX to lock FXS (in the form of veFXS), participate in FRAX governance, and provide additional rewards to Frax gauge ecosystem participants.The VeFXSProxy contract for STAX veFXS staking is deployed on mainnet: <0xdf291abc418b074cf7ec304c1608aa5346e4e10b>

STAX is a TempleDAO project.

Abstract

STAX is a protocol built on top of Frax Finance to provide enhanced farming yields via Locked Liquidity and veFXS boost to FRAX LP providers and FXS stakers through the social aggregation of $FXS deposits. It will also provide additional rewards to those Frax stakeholders via $STAX, the native utility token of STAX. We plan to distribute STAX platform fees to $STAX stakers.

For FXS Stakers, STAX provides a seamless onboarding process to veFXS by creating a tokenised wrapper token called staxFXS which will represent the veFXS locked for the maximum time in the VotingEscrow contract. The lock will be continually refreshed to prevent time decay on the veFXS boost to LP positions. The staxFXS token can be staked to receive existing rewards ($FXS) from Frax Finance, STAX platform revenues in the form of $staxFXS, and additional $STAX rewards. Though the staxFXS conversion is a one-way operation, users will be able to swap their $staxFXS back to $FXS at any time through a deep stable swap pool on Curve Finance.

Having a synergistic relationship with FXS holders is imperative to the success of STAX and to create a value-added relationship between the FRAX and STAX communities. FXS that is locked in STAX will be removed from circulation and will be continuously re-locked. By increasing demand for FXS we hope to drive utility and demand for the governance token of FRAX.

For Liquidity Providers, STAX provides a secondary yield aggregator interface to drive more deposits into the Frax gauge. STAX would allow depositors to achieve a high reward boost through the protocol-owned veFXS, and in some LPs the potential of Locked LP Boost while also benefiting from $STAX rewards.

If whitelisted for FXS staking, STAX Team will follow post-launch with veFXS boost and $STAX token rewards in August of 2022 after the liquidity generation event.

Brief Background & Motivation:

TempleDAO (the engineering team behind STAX) was an early backer of Frax Finance by conducting its presale exclusively in FRAX, and became a top holder with one of the largest FRAX reserves ($137M). The current TVL in the FRAX/TEMPLE LP gauge is over $37M. We have been closely allied with the Frax ecosystem and a vast majority of our Treasury is held in FRAX-denominated assets.

Since March, TempleDAO has spent over $600K at Pitch.money on veFXS holder bribes to further promote the Frax ecosystem and increase our FXS holdings. TEMPLE aspires to be the stable growth altcoin in a world of volatility by driving deep liquidity with blue-chip stablecoin pairs and utility for use as a lending collateral. Through STAX, which will bring liquidity to locked Frax gauge LP positions, we aim to facilitate deeper TEMPLE liquidity and TVL, and potentially expand to other LP pools.

Draft STAX Tokenomics

10,000,000 tokens

72% for user LP staking rewards / Pool 2 emissions initially to support:

STAX LP Pool

FRAX-TEMPLE Pool

Locked STAX

14% STAX Treasury reserve

6% Team

3% Liquidity Generation Event Participants

3% Initial liquidity

2% Emissions to Temple Core vault stakers (over X months)

STAX Governance

If whitelisted for veFXS locking, the STAX Protocol would be expected to wield a significant percentage of the veFXS voting power over time. Because STAX would help direct the flow of FXS incentives in the FRAX ecosystem, it is of paramount importance that this economic power is fully decentralized.

STAX governance will be a further iteration of the TempleDAO representative governance model. The $STAX token is intended post-launch to have appropriate governance rights for the STAX platform. STAX voters will be able to direct the vote on the Frax gauge using the STAX protocol-owned veFXS voting power.

At launch, STAX would use its veFXS to vote for the FRAX/TEMPLE LP gauge. At this time, the STAX team is considering a second FRAX pool cross chain (not a FRAX gauge) that also has strategic ties to the FRAX and TEMPLE ecosystems.

Post launch, the locked $STAX token will direct STAX emissions between these TEMPLE pools. Any expansion of STAX beyond the FRAX/TEMPLE pool into other FRAX gauges would be made through representative governance. This transition would take place after STAX voting contracts are battle-tested, and the STAX voter base has matured. At maturity, control of STAX will be passed from the starting 3 of 4 multisig Gnosis safe to a suite of on-chain contracts.

STAX Team

The STAX Team is comprised of TempleDAO builders who have a proven track record of delivering innovative DeFi products such as the Temple Defense which has successfully protected the intrinsic value backing of $TEMPLE through the recent downturn, and the TempleDAO Uni v2 custom AMM which has smoothly handled over $270M in FRAX/TEMPLE LP transaction volume while providing additional features such as minting and price floor defense.

STAX Contracts / Audits

The MVP version of STAX that we have just launched in June is a sneak preview of the full product that will be launched in a few months. The STAX v0.1 dApp currently contains a single gauge LP (FRAX/TEMPLE) and provides a user-friendly front-end for the AddLiquidity method for the Uni v2 LP contract currently deployed for the Temple custom AMM. You may read more about STAX v0.1 in our recent Medium article which can be found on our website below.

The full set of STAX contracts will be derived from the battle-tested Curve code base. We have scheduled an audit with Peckshield in July, which also performed an audit of the original TEMPLE contracts that were successfully deployed last year at our public launch.

Conclusion

In summary, STAX will support $FXS price by driving demand for $FXS and becoming a long-term protocol holder. STAX would accumulate $FXS to boost the FRAX/TEMPLE LP gauge, which continues to be a significant FRAX farm and a driver for locked FRAX liquidity. TempleDAO will be a long-term holder of FRAX, and a key participant in the FRAX bribe ecosystem.

A vote for STAX Finance to gain veFXS whitelist is supportive of FRAX, FXS price, FRAX bribe ecosystem, TempleDAO, and the FRAX/TEMPLE gauge. A clear win for both communities.

Haym Salomon and DeFi Dave

Proposal

Grant $50,000 worth of FRAX and $25,000 worth of FXS to launch Protocol Research Unit with the goal of identifying and modeling Frax core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), developing proof-of-concept dashboards and a business cycle process. This grant is for a trial period of ten weeks.

Background

Frax Finance launched in December 2020 with a lot of promise. In the short 1.5 years since launch, Frax has grown from an upstart stablecoin experiment to an increasingly influential pillar of DeFi. If/when FRAXBP passes, Frax Finance will become deeply intertwined with Curve Finance and Convex Finance, binding the three in a novel Protocol Triumvirate.

Since genesis, the Frax team has (and will continue to) delivered around-the-clock efforts to develop world class technology and economic theory. DeFi is entering a critical juncture with the creation of FRAXBP, the loss of Terra, the lurking MEV issue, etc. The Frax core chain must continue pushing innovation on-chain.

As Frax matures into the full-fledged ecosystem it has been building towards its inception, it must accept the responsibility to clearly define, monitor and execute against data-driven KPIs. Because of this, Frax must formalize its own key success, risk and health indicators; not only provide the Frax core team more data to make better-informed decisions, but also to lead by example as a responsible steward of all of DeFi.

Summary

Deliverables:

The project will provide a full accounting and will return any unspent funds to the Frax Finance treasury.

Requests in this proposal take into account funding from previous grants (for community websites and dashboards) Those who are currently being funded by those grants will not be eligible for rewards.

Timeline

Deliverables will be interactively produced throughout the ten week period as individual items are complete.

It is anticipated that the first week will be used to set up operations and the next nine weeks will be used to execute. When we seek renewal when the period ends, we will have a better idea of the associated costs of our efforts.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The primary purpose of this proposal is to rigorously define and document the most important KPIs for Frax Finance. We will limit our findings to include no more than 6 primary KPIs.

Initial starting ideas:

Frax Finance veFXS locked %

Protocol Controlled Liquidity (POL)

Financial Performance

EBITDA, revenue and costs

Assets under management

Cost of capital

DeFi Dominance

Stablecoin dominance

DEX dominance (Fraxswap), lending dominance (Fraxlend), staking dominance

Centralization

Decentralization Ratio

Counterparty exposures and measures

Whale exposures and activity

Motivation

In May 2022, DeFi and crypto were rocked when UST broke its peg and the TerraLuna ecosystem collapsed. In the aftermath, regulators, TradFi and the general public immediately began asking questions and demanding for action to be taken. As regulation begins to take shape, it has become more and more clear that Frax Finance does not have (and is not prepared for) a seat at the table at those levels.

On the heels of the collapse of TerraLuna, community members such as 0xHamz (@0xHamz on Twitter) have discussed large-scale real world opportunities. This correctly identifies a huge opportunity for scaling both Frax as an organization but also (given Frax’s role and the nature of FRAX) DeFi in general.

As Frax Finance grows in both on-chain scale and DAO contributors, it becomes more and more critical to clearly define success and organize the DAO, investors and the crypto community around simple and transparent metrics.

The first step in order to address both impending risks and RWA opportunities is to formalize organizational structure, metric and processes. The Protocol Research Unit will engage in a holistic and a financial review of the Frax protocol to define and begin tracking these metrics.

Using these KPIs and reporting as a basis, Frax will be able to provide clear, concise and reliable information to Frax operations, investors and media creators alike. Upon successful completion of the trial period, we intend to submit proposals better focusing on each of these three key stakeholders.

Summary

Create dAMM AMO to provide market makers access to FRAX ecosystem tokens, and establish FRAX as the primary stablecoin of dAMM.

About dAMM Finance dAMM is an under-collateralized lending platform for any token with algorithmically determined interest rates. Any token with a liquidity pool on dAMM, market makers and investors can borrow on dAMM to provide liquidity and trade across all centralized and decentralized trading venues. More details about the dAMM protocol can be found in our whitepaper: https://damm-finance.gitbook.io/damm-finance/0onmhbd8IPAoHstKw9eg/introduction/abstract

3

Our investors include many major exchanges and market makers, including: Kronos Research/WOO Network, System 9, AscendEx and Gate Ventures. Our founding team are members of System 9, one of the largest alt-coin market makers in crypto. System 9 is the dedicated market market for more than 80 alt-coins as the dedicated market maker and was founded by market makers from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, JP Morgan Capital, and Bear Stearns. Our protocol is open source here: github.com

The Compound On-Chain Protocol. Contribute to system9development/compound-protocol development by creating an account on GitHub.

Background and Motivation dAMM is the first under-collateralized lending platform for any token, offering DAO’s and token issuers the ability to lend their assets directly to market makers seeking to provide liquidity in their respective markets. A core stablecoin is necessary for the dAMM protocol, and when examining the current stablecoin landscape, FRAX stood out as the clear favorite amongst the dAMM team for a number of reasons. FRAX pioneered the AMO primitive which has fostered mutually-beneficial relationships with partner protocolsFor this reason, we believe that a FRAX AMO to seed stablecoin liquidity to dAMM is a clear value add for both protocols; as well as establishing FRAX as the native stablecoin of dAMM. dAMM AMO Goals:

For this AMO, our goal is to provide FRAX with an organic and sustainable stream of revenue from lending to dAMM borrowers, as well as ownership over the dAMM protocol through a retro-active airdrop to DAOs and token issuer’s that are allocating to dAMM based on their allocation size.

Interest payments on dAMM are paid out in the native token of the pool (FRAX in the FRAX pool, FXS in the FXS pool, etc).

10% of all borrower interest payments on the protocol are passed directly to gdAMM (staked dAMM) holders in stablecoin rewards. If this partnership is accepted between dAMM and FRAX through this AMO, those rewards would be paid out in FRAX; making FRAX the native reward asset of dAMM staking.

Risk Mitigation of dAMM:

To mitigate default risk, the dAMM Foundation requires all market makers borrowing from the protocol to sign a master loan agreement, and provide monthly audited financial statements for our credit risk team’s due diligence. The total amount a market maker can borrow is capped as a percentage of their balance sheet as determined by the jurisdiction and licenses of the borrower. All borrowers on the protocol are also required to stake a portion of their loan value in the form of dAMM as well.

Conclusion dAMM is the first protocol for any token to be borrowed under-collateralized by institutional borrowers. Our intention as well regardless of the proposal’s success is to list all four native FRAX assets (FRAX, FXS, FPI, FPIS) for institutional borrowers. We also seek to list more than 200 tokens in the first year of the protocol being live.

Our long term goal with this AMO is to create a mutually beneficial partnership between our protocols and generate revenue for the FRAX ecosystem, as well as put FRAX in the hands of reputable market makers and institutional borrowers.

We’re incredibly excited to partner with FRAX!

For: Create the dAMM AMO and authorize up to $10mm of FRAX for use in the AMO.

Summary

The purpose of this proposal is to adopt Commonwealth as the governance forum and voting interface for the Frax community. Commonwealth offers a fully crypto-native forum, voting interface (polls, Snapshot, and on-chain governance), and chat all in one product. Commonwealth is free to use and will soon be fully-decentralized.

Details

About Commonwealth

Commonwealth is an all-in-one platform for decentralized communities to run themselves. We eliminate the need for multiple governance products / DAO tools. We offer fully crypto native discussion, chat, polling, onchain governance, Snapshot support, and member analytics / profiles. We power over 700+ DAOs including dYdX, Redacted Cartel, Axie Infinity, Osmosis, Stargate, Element Finance, Spiritswap, and soon Olympus. Commonwealth has raised $23.2M from Dragonfly, Parafi, Polychain, Framework, Hashed, Nascent, Spark, Balaji, Stani, and others.

Goal

To migrate the current Frax forum to Commonwealth and integrate your Snapshot / governance.

The Problem

Currently the Frax governance community is highly fragmented (Telegram, Discord, Discourse, Snapshot, on-chain voting) and has little transparency into the discussion / voting activity.

Create a new account for Discourse with an email (non-sybil resistant, non-spam resistant)

Create other web2 accounts (Telegram, Discord)

Missing the link between forum discussions, chat, and voting

Need to now use 3-5 platforms for every DAO a member is a part of

The Solution

Integrating Commonwealth is incredibly easy, the user journey would look like this:

Import the Frax Discourse to Commonwealth (maintains all content and profiles)

Link Frax governance and Snapshot (creates bidirectional governance interfaces)

Community owned and run

For users, using Commonwealth is simple:

Link your wallet via Metamask or Wallet Connect

Join the Frax forum

Link the same email you used for Discourse to claim your old account

Begin discussing, chatting, creating proposals, and voting in one space for all of your communities

Benefits to the Frax Community

To summarize, below are the key benefits for the end users:

Simplified user journey to interact with the Frax community

Totally free to use

Fully crypto native experience

In-app crowdfunding (soon)

DAO tool app store (soon)

Summary

Create a Centrifuge AMO to provide liquidity across our Senior pools.

About Centrifuge

Centrifuge is a pioneering project that connects real-world assets (RWAs) to DeFi offering a fully transparent protocol which allows borrowers and lenders to transact without unnecessary intermediaries. Ultimately, the protocol aims to lower the cost of borrowing for businesses around the world, while providing users with a stable source of collateralized yield that is uncorrelated to the volatile crypto markets. Centrifuge was the first DeFi protocol to bridge RWAs on-chain and has integrated with some of the leading protocols, including MakerDAO and Aave.

Centrifuge asset pools are fully collateralized by underlying RWAs and investors have legal rights to the collateral in the case of a default. This makes Centrifuge unique versus many of our RWA peers that largely focus on undercollateralized lending. NFTs are used as digital representations of the RWAs on-chain, allowing investors to have full visibility on the exact collateral they finance. The protocol is asset class agnostic and has created pools for assets such as mortgages, invoices and consumer finance. Centrifuge on-chain stats can be found here 4. Key metrics: $85M TVL $125M+ in net assets financed

100s of underlying assets financed

Centrifuge dapp (Tinlake) overview

Issuers use Tinlake to access capital, which in turn is used to finance real-world businesses. Assets are posted as collateral (visible on-chain) and users are able to generate yield according to their risk appetite. Much like many traditional asset finance transactions, Tinlake pools are divided into two tranches (senior and junior). These tranches are used to offer investors differing risk/reward profiles.

Senior tranche (DROP): The senior tranche is the largest tranche and is structured to have a stable fixed return. It is insulated from losses by the riskier junior tranche, which in the case of default will absorb any losses before the senior tranche is affected. This is a lower risk offering that is designed as a fixed income product.

Junior tranche (TIN): The junior tranche is a smaller percentage of the overall pool and is structured to offer investors a variable return. The junior tranche will capture the residual cash flows in the pool after the senior investors have been fully paid back. As mentioned above, this means that any losses will first be attributed to this riskier tranche. The junior tranche is designed to potentially offer higher returns, but is volatile in nature.

See our docs for a deeper understanding of how our dapp Tinlake works.

Returns

Senior (DROP): returns vary according to the asset class and the corresponding risk of the underlying assets being financed. Current live opportunities on Tinlake have an APY between 3.5 - 10%.

Junior (TIN): returns are riskier and highly variable. Current live opportunities on Tinlake have an APY between 15 - 50%+.

Liquidity

Centrifuge offers revolving pools. Revolving pools mean users can invest/redeem at any time they wish. A decentralized solver mechanism matches investments and redemptions with the available liquidity in the pool, allowing users to move in and out of the pool if/when liquidity is available. This brings liquidity to a traditionally illiquid asset class.

Investor Protection & Legal Framework

Our top priority is investor protection. As a result, we created a template legal structure that is unique in the DeFi ecosystem and gives users protection should a pool go into default. As is seen in traditional financial structures, users sign agreements that give them legal recourse to the underlying assets used as collateral in the pool.

Read more about our template legal structure here 6.

Motivation

Frax is one of the most advanced and promising stablecoins in the Web3 ecosystem. As FRAX looks to diversify their collateral base the community has been forward looking in using RWAs to do so. RWAs offer FRAX a unique source of yield that is uncorrelated to the broader crypto ecosystem, while offering the necessary stability to underpin long-term growth. Centrifuge offers FRAX the opportunity to participate in a wide range of asset classes that can truly diversify the FRAX collateral base. It also offers FRAX the opportunity to proliferate outside the crypto ecosystem and impact the lives and livelihoods of many people around the globe.

From the Centrifuge side we are keen to work with what we view as the fastest growing stablecoin in the ecosystem. FRAX has proven it can scale and we therefore view FRAX as a long-term sustainable source of capital that can help shape the RWA dream. We would be excited to welcome such a partner to the Centrifuge community and very much look forward to the potential collaboration.

Frax Core Team

Summary

Allocate 1.2m FRAX to the core treasury for use on quarterly security audits.

Background and Motivation

FRAX has had impeccable security to date in its 17 months being live. We have had 0 critical vulnerabilities where the protocol or any user has lost funds to a vulnerability/bug. This is because the core team takes security extremely seriously and has recurring audits scheduled with some of the top firms in the industry such as Trail of Bits. All of the protocol audits are published in our documentation as they become available: https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits

These audits typically take 2-4 weeks depending on amount of engineers involved and go through protocol code extensively. We would like to allocate 1.2m FRAX to pay for annual security budget and recurring, quarterly audits by top firms. It is likely that the total amount will not be used over 12 months which will roll over to the next 12 month period. In the event that the budget is used in under 12 months due to the size of FRAX's core protocol contracts+code, we will propose a new budget allocation so that governance must approve it.

Seeing as how security and top audits are one of, if not most, important aspects of building a reputable and great defi protocol, we assume this will be an easy pass. For comparison, this is the annual budget for all security related audits+expenses which is less than ~5 days of protocol revenue. This small expenditure is one of the most important expenses of any defi project.

Proposal

Grant $18,000 worth of FXS and FRAX (split 50/50) for a 3 month period for funding a Frax-centric media effort that covers protocol developments as well as interviews prominent players within the ecosystem.

Background

We propose that the Frax DAO take the first step in increasing awareness of the Frax protocol in order to better educate the wider community, clear and more effectively proliferate narratives to the wider crypto space. This proposal will help fund: -Flywheel, a Frax-focused podcast dedicated to interviewing and shining a light on members of the Frax community including core team devs, outside contributors, large stakeholders, and everyone in between. -A weekly Twitter space, the Frax Town Square, dedicated to discussing Frax governance proposals and hosting authors of those proposals to make their case to the community. -Fraxcast, a weekly news roundup of everything happening in the ecosystem including stats, developments, partnerships, etc.

Costs associated with each episode will cover subscription expenses and labor hours spent prepping, recording, editing, and distributing content.

The people behind this initiative include: -Sam McCulloch (@ssmccul 1) who is a long-time member of the Frax community and has had a podcast of his own. Sam will be the lead and producer for the unit and will act as producer to both shows as well as co-host the Frax Town Square. -DeFi Dave (@davesaidthat_ 1) who is a Day Zero Fraximalist and has hosted a podcast in the past, The DeFi Scoop. He will co-host both Flywheel and Frax Town Square. -kapital_k (0xkapital_k 1) who is a DeFi/Gaming/Tokenomics enthusiast and Frax supporter who has researched the protocol deeply.

Motivation

It has become common practice for platforms and protocols to have their own media initiatives to keep members of their community informed and engaged. Protocols that have had podcasts in the past include Olympus DAO, Redacted, and others. These niche podcasts play an important role by providing color to what is happening at the bleeding edges of financial innovation in each of their respected corners of DeFi. In the Frax ecosystem alone, their are numerous developments happening that it is hard to keep track of all the progress.

Sam Kazemian has done an excellent job championing the Frax ecosystem by going on countless podcasts, spaces, and everything in between over the past few years. Yet, the Frax ecosystem is growing to become much bigger than Sam and the core team alone. Numerous contributors and commentators have arisen that can and will continue to advance the Frax forward into the future.

Summary

Unlock the FRAX-FXS Uni v2 LP pool to deprecate its FXS rewards and deploy a FRAX-FXS Fraxswap gauge.

Background and Motivation

The FRAX-FXS Uni v2 LP token is the oldest FRAX farm started at genesis on December 20, 2020. Other than the 12,500 FXS emitted per day across all gauges, ~8400 FXS is emitted through this single FRAX-FXS LP pair which accounts for nearly 40% of all FXS emissions.

By deprecating this pair and moving FRAX-FXS LPs to Fraxswap under the gauge system, FXS immediately becomes 40% more scarce as the amount emitted per day drops from 12,500+8400=20,900 to just 12,500 across the entire protocol. This is an important step in making the protocol more profitable, capital efficient, and overall consolidating all FXS emissions into the elegant gauge system.

The only potential reason to vote against this proposal is the danger of ~66% of the FRAX-FXS LP locked liquidity being set free. This means about 20m FRAX and 3.6m FXS would be unlocked and able to be sold immediately on deprecation of this pair. It's important to consider the absolute worst case scenario that 100% of all unlocked liquidity is sold to exit the protocol. When we considered this, we concluded that 20m FRAX sold into Curve/Uniswap is immaterial and completely manageable with no danger to the peg. Selling 3.6m FXS could materially impact FXS price since most of the liquidity would be gone. However, this is mitigated by the protocol deploying FRAX-FXS POL into Fraxswap which it currently already has to the tune of $13m liquidity. The protocol could increase its POL in Fraxswap up to $50m to make the liquidity depth comparable to the FRAX-FXS Uniswap v2 pool. Additionally, the high yield opportunities in veFXS, cvxFXS, as well as the FRAX-FXS gauge that will come with this proposal will immediately give unlocked LPs a lucrative place to continue to earn yield and continue to support the protocol. We believe a sizable portion of early supporters and LPs will move over to the other lucrative staking opportunities for FRAX and FXS rather than exit. Nevertheless, even under the worst mathematical scenario that 100% of unlocked LPs sell both FRAX and FXS, we've shown the material impact is nothing to the peg and minimal to FXS price (as long as the protocol increases its FRAX-FXS POL on Fraxswap). In fact, we anticipate this could have a profoundly positive impact+sentiment on FXS price in the short to medium term as a large source of FXS emission is permanently cut from the market.

Overall, we analyzed that this is an incredibly lucrative opportunity for the protocol to cut down 40% of its inflation, make FXS more scarce, add a new gauge, and make use of its ability to deploy FRAX-FXS POL to create a lot of value.

PROPOSAL

For:

Unlock FRAX-FXS Uni v2 LP & discontinue its FXS rewards. Deploy FRAX-FXS Fraxswap LP gauge.

Against:

Do nothing

AMENDMENT 6/12/22

FRAX-FXS Gauge for this proposal should have a 1 year lock with 3x boost instead of the 3 year lock for 3x boost. This is because we've analyzed that we can get a higher amount of liquidity in each gauge and maximize the locking mechanism if we lower the max lock time to 1 year. Thus, gauge proposals will be for deployment of 1 year lock style unless otherwise specified.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0xc41b1c1dcb2d9b91cd15319f4a5d6757aa5cb16c970465ae9d5e53ae6f28a4f4

Summary:

Deposit 20-40% of protocol wide farmed CRV into cvxCRV and stake to create more revenue/cash flow for the protocol via CRV emissions and Curve fees (3pool stablecoins), as well as more CVX emissions for Frax to lock. CRV will be deposited directly into cvxCrv if the market discount is lower or equal to 3% and can be swapped if higher.  The deposit amount will be decided by the Frax team based on market conditions at the time of deposit as long as it is in the defined 20-40% range.

Related Readings:

Please read the Curve proposal and future roadmap laid out by Sam at ( https://gov.curve.fi/t/deploy-a-fraxbp-pool-whitelist-frax-for-vecrv-staking/3958 )

Details:

I have been in discussion with Sam for many months now about how Frax could use their farmed rewards more efficiently.  At face value there is a big decision of lower immediate profits vs long term sustainability.  With the advance of a few key points, we think we have found a good solution on what can be done.  This will be a multi step procedure involving multiple proposals on both Frax and Curve.  This proposal is the first step.

Currently CRV farmed by POL are being sold and returned to veFXS holders as revenue.  This proposal will allocate a portion of that CRV to create another revenue stream that will compound farming rewards.  This gives Frax not only continued crv/cvx rewards but also gives the platform a revenue stream in stable coins. This will provide a nicer balance and stability to revenue which is less volatile than governance token farming. The current APR as of this writing is 52.7%, of which 32.4% is in stablecoins via Curve admin fees. While recent turbulent times have had a negative effect on CRV prices, trading fees have increased dramatically.  This should clearly show that it should be a priority for Frax to have more revenue streams denominated in different token types.

Until Curve whitelist is passed and frax3crv is deprecated for its fraxbp replacement, the Frax team can use cvxCrv as incentives on Votium. Their goal and mandate should be to try to stock pile cvxCrv but also use what's necessary to keep proper liquidity incentives. This balance is decided by the team.

Merits:

Compoundable CRV

More CVX rewards to increase Frax's CVX position.

Stablecoin revenue stream

More vecrv power to Frax's CVX holdings.

Future Plans:

This proposal is for stockpiling cvxCRV as a revenue stream.  In a future proposal, we will lay out a system in which frax can use this cvxCRV in a way that will capture more gauge weight and increase Frax liquidity.  This is the first step and follows closely with the Curve proposal posted by Sam, as well as the future release of Fraxlend.

This proposal's purpose is to approve the funding of $100K FRAX into an unbalanced FRAX/arUSD liquidity pool in partnership with Arable Protocol. In partnership with this approval, the Arable Protocol will provide arUSD liquidity to complete the pool and enable FRAX and FPIS as collateral, enabling FRAX/FPIS holders the ability to mint arUSD.

Summary

Arable Protocol proposes:

The creation and funding of an unbalanced FRAX/arUSD pool based on Arable’s swap contract.

To integrate FRAX and FPIS assets as supported collateral at Arable Protocol.

Background

Arable Protocol is reshaping the DeFi space. Our goal is to make multi-chain farming simple, economical, and available to all. With a simple yet powerful user interface, both experienced and new farmers can effortlessly stake yield farms from various chains. Arable allows for multi-chain yield farming on a single platform and chain without leaving the App. With ever-rising gas prices and bridging fees reducing revenues, it's time for a revolution!

Arable Protocol is based around a synthetic ecosystem and its liquidity is created through the minting of the stable asset arUSD. Utilizing arUSD, users can swap between a variety of synthetic cryptocurrencies and LP tokens and farm on synthetic yield farms that track the APR of their native chain counterparts. Collateral is required to back minted arUSD in an over-collateralized fashion. We propose to add FRAX and FPIS as collateral options to Arable’s current collateral options, including USDT, WAVAX, and Arable’s own governance token, ACRE. To find out more, please refer to https://medium.com/@ArableProtocol/35e2c39a0c87 .

To incentivize the utilization of FRAX as collateral, we propose the creation and funding of an unbalanced (no slippage or impermanent loss) FRAX/arUSD pool based on Arable’s swap contract. The Frax protocol will add a one-sided deposit of $100k FRAX, which will be matched with $100k arUSD by the Arable Protocol for a total liquidity of $200k.

Rationale

Increasing volume and liquidity for both protocols.

By supporting FRAX and FPIS as additional collateral options by Arable Protocol and the creation of a FRAX/arUSD liquidity pool, such a partnership would result in increased liquidity for and visibility of our respective protocols.

Arable Protocol and the Frax Finance community have strongly aligned interests and will benefit from more exposure to each other's communities.

Exploration of further co-marketing opportunities will lead to increased visibility of each other’s communities and user bases.

Building trust through partnership.

By developing a long-term partnership, we can build trust with each other by ensuring fair and level compensation between the two protocols.

The purpose of this proposal is to integrate Transak´s fiat on-ramp service on app.frax.finance in order to allow users to buy FRAX and other tokens directly from the dApp using credit/debit cards, bank transfers, Apple Pay, Google Pay and other local payment methods in more than 125+countries.

Details

About Transak

Transak is a single integration for applications to enable fiat-to-crypto on-ramp for a global user base. It does this by providing API-driven fiat payment methods to the on-ramp to 100+ crypto assets and abstracting away the complexity of user KYC, risk monitoring & compliance, payment methods, and customer support. Transak is already supported in tier 1 exchanges and wallets such as Beefy finance, Aave, Metamask, Trustwallet, Ledger, and hundreds of leading crypto projects.

Goal

To integrate the Transak widget into app.frax.finance UI so that users can buy FRAX and other tokens across all supported chains using any of the supported fiat currencies through their preferred payment methods.

The Problem

Unfortunately, to start for example staking or yield farming on frax.finance, users have to obtain their cryptocurrencies beforehand in order to interact with the protocol. A user would have to go through as many as three steps before reaching their end goal:

Deposit fiat into a centralised exchange

Buy ETH and withdraw to your non-custodial wallet

Connect to a DEX like Uniswap to get your FRAX tokens

Finally connect to app.frax.finance and start your DeFi adventure

The Solution

By integrating Transak, the user journey would look like this:

Buy FRAX with fiat directly from app.frax.finance

Start your DeFi journey

Benefits to the Frax Community

To summarise, below are the key benefits for the end users:

Simplified user journey to buy with fiat using your preferred payment method

Support for over 120+ countries with fees as low as 0.99%

FRAX will also be available to purchase on transak.com and other Transak partners (Metamask, Ledger, etc..), increasing visibility to and brand recognition

Benefit from Transak’s experimental features like

1-click to protocol where users can buy and stake with fiat in a single transaction.

How it works

Using this integration, the user clicks on the “buy with fiat” button on the FRAX DApp to launch the Transak Widget. You will be prompted to the widget where you select your preferred currency and the amount, your preferred payment method and the token to purchase. You then paste your wallet address and complete the transaction. Transak abstracts all the complexity of the payment flow and makes it simple for the user — Fiat in Crypto out.

Stop selling 100% of our farmed CRV and start using part of them to gain voting power on Curve through the Stake DAO CRV Liquid Locker, to maximize the efficiency of our strategy to maximize Frax liquidity and its domination in the algorithmic stable coin ecosystem.

Context:

With $1.8 billion deposited on Curve via AMOs, Frax is one of the largest CRV farmers in the ecosystem. However, since we were not allowed to obtain a whitelist on Curve's governance to have the possibility of locking those CRV and voting on Curve, we were forced to sell them. Today, we have the possibility of voting on Curve with those CRV via Stake DAO’s new whitelist-as-a-service offer.

StakeDAO, (with which we already have partnerships on different fronts), recently released a ""Whitelist-as-a-Service"" offer, an alternative solution of liquid form for veMODEL tokenomics. They have already released a liquid locker for $ANGLE, $FXS and $CRV ( https://lockers.stakedao.org/ ). They also just passed a vote to have a gauge for their different sdTKN/TKN pools on Curve.

How do liquid lockers work ? (example for $CRV)

The liquid locker has a Curve whitelist, a reward contract, and a Curve Factory Pool. The $CRV staked in the liquid locker are locked for 4 years and perpetually relocked.

This locking allows maximized voting power and rewards.Whenever a governance proposal is listed on Curve’s governance, it is automatically reflected in the sdCRV snapshot, and every other week, a gauge vote is published on this Snapshot. sdCRV stakers can then vote for their preferred pools or governance choices, and those votes will be reflected directly in Curve’s governance.

They also mentioned they were targeting to make these lockers cross-chain, which could be interesting for the $CRV we farm on other chains in the future. $sdCRV holders will be allowed to stake in them on StakeDAO to receive:

Native APR (rewards in 3crv)

Share of 8% of all the corresponding strat rewards (rewards in $CRV)

The ability to vote or sell their voting rights from their $sdCRV

Additional SDT incentives (rewards in $SDT)

Recap:

Rationale:

The goal of this proposal is to start using part of our farmed $CRV to gain a better edge in the Curve lobbying ecosystem. Part of our farmed CRV could be locked in the $CRV liquid lockers created by Stake DAO and would have a voting power even without having a whitelist directly on Curve. Furthermore, as Frax already owns some SDT, we will benefit from a boost on our rewards and CRV voting power.

By using Stake DAO’s CRV liquid locker, our CRV would be put to work and we would benefit from: veCRV trading fees in 3CRV (as if we were locking CRV for 4 years)

Additional yield paid in CRV (platform fees coming from boost mutualisation)

SDT incentives, which would allow us to boost our yield and voting power if locked on Stake DAO

Liquidity (possibility to exit whenever we want through a pool on Curve. Liquidity TBC)

And the most important: voting rights on Curve to boost our pools or pass governance proposals. We could even boost our voting rights up to 2x by holding veSDT (cf this medium ). We could use the 3CRV farmed to increase the liquidity of FRAX, use the CRV farmed to increase again the yields and create a voting flywheel offor our pools via voting on Curve;, finally and lock the SDT to boost our yield and voting power on Curve.

Building an $sdCRV position would allow Frax to gain more voting power over Curve's governance, thus boosting $CRV rewards for our pools. Furthermore, with the reduced selling pressure on $CRV, they APY should structurally go up, increasing the DAO’s revenue and attractivity of our pools.

As the $veCRV will be cross-chain and cross-chain gauges are already a reality via Multichain any calls, if Frax decides to launch cross-chain AMOs, it may be possible to stake the $sdCRV directly on the chain where the $CRV is farmed.

Technical implementation:

No technical development needed.

Yes, allow depositing a portion of our farmed CRV into Stake DAO liquid lockers

No, do nothing

Remove FRAX/mUSD gauge so the pool stops receiving FXS.

As pointed out by community members, FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool is relatively small in terms of TVL and participation in 24h volume of FRAX transactions. Especially with the recent market concerns with stable coins, users not comfortable holding mUSD (fine with holding frax though)

We would like to propose removing the gauge from FXS as this essentially allows stable pools and other FRAX/FXS/FPI/FPIS-focused pools to gain more rewards. Also, FXS emission would be used more efficiently for the stability of FRAX as well as the extension of the market cap of that.

This is somewhat of an unusual proposal and it will also be used as a way to test community sentiment on having FXS receiving gauges on pools that source their yield from FXS.

Implementation:

We will set the farm reward to 0 for FRAX/mUSD pool and people can withdraw from the farm afterward.

Revised proposal - this proposal has been revised to remove discussion about liquidity assistance or migration to a Fraxswap pool until a further vote. This proposal will only deal with the unlocking of current LPs and the transfer of the current FRAX-IQ pool to the Frax gauge system program.

Summary

This proposal, if passed, would move the FRAX-IQ FXS rewards pool to Fraxswap and the FXS gauge reward system. The current FXS emissions directed to FRAX-IQ are to be ceased and retained in the treasury.

Background

Currently, we are spending about $8mm a year in FXS on rewards for the FRAX-IQ pool which has a TVL of $5.6mm. The FRAX-IQ pool is an outlier in that its rewards are not set by the gauges - I propose that we change that.

While we are very close to the Everipedia community, I think it is time we reassessed whether the current arrangement serves either community very well - as it appears to create inefficient dilution to FXS holders and does not allow Everipedia to use its IQ token to bribe in the gauge system.

For example, it would be far more beneficial for FXS holders if we bonded FRAX-IQ in through Olympus Pro for FXS - at the end of a year instead of paying out $8mm in FXS for temporary liquidity of $2.8mm in FRAX we would own $8mm worth of FRAX-IQ liquidity.

Everipedia themselves have been using Olympus Pro to build up their own liquidity - pulling in $1.4mm on ETH mainnet and $250K on Arbitrum.

This should provide Everipedia some buffer if there are LP's who decide to cease liquidity provision as a result of moving the FRAX-IQ pool to the Frax gauge system.

Motivation

This proposal's motivation is to:

Cease inefficient dilution to FXS holders directed at the FRAX-IQ pool outside the FXS gauge system

Allow the Everipedia community to use its IQ token for gauge reward bribes instead of co-pool incentives

Proposal

This proposal will:

Unlock the current FRAX-IQ pool liquidity providers

Transfer the current FRAX-IQ pool to the FXS gauge system with immediate effect.

This will allow Everipedia to use IQ incentives to bribe their gauge and compete in the Frax wars which is beneficial to both Frax and Everipedia.

The current FXS emissions directed to FRAX-IQ are to be ceased and retained in the Frax community treasury.

Vote

For - Transfer FRAX-IQ pool to the FXS gauge system

Against - Do nothing",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0xd988da5727eb67b626e736d38d4c035a743e1a5398653afa16f1b12215731960

The proposer is Ozys team, developer of KLAYswap, Orbit chain, Belt-fi, and our upcoming DEX protocol on the MATIC ecosystem. Our team has been discussing possible potential collaboration points with the FRAX team for a long period of time.

Through a series of discussions, we are pleased to present the exclusive financial opportunities to FRAX community users as well as our newly developed DEX protocol called ‘Meshswap’. Before further elaborating on the opportunities that our new DEX protocol ‘Meshswap’ would offer to the FRAX community, kindly allow us to briefly introduce the background of our new DEX protocol.

Meshswap is a MATIC-customized version of DEX that follows the basic structure of KLAYswap and is also developed by Ozys. To be specific, KLAYswap is a Klaytn’s main DEX protocol that once took up about half of the liquidity in Klaytn ecosystem, which recorded $ 2 bil TVL(Total Value Locked) last year and ranked 17th globally. Based on the high level of performance and completeness on the product side (AMM, staking, leveraging, IDO, etc), and almost completely decentralized and effectively working governance system of KLAYswap, we are about to expand our ecosystem into MATIC ecosystem which holds more than $10 bil Market cap with our new DEX protocol, “Meshswap”.

Main proposal contents

Liquidity provision of FRAX by foundation in purpose of creating a pair pool on Meshswap

Creating FRAX pair pool including FRAX-MATIC, FRAX-MESH in Meshswap by foundation $ 10 mil for each pool (size of liquidity that withstands $10,000 transaction with less than 1% of slippage)

Partnership (FRAX x Meshswap)

FRAX to Meshswap: liquidity provision, co-promotion

Meshswap to FRAX: fruitful financial opportunities to users including mining, and adding leveraging feature for FRAX in purpose of transaction amplification further cooperation with Ozys team (developer of KLAYswap, Orbit chain, Belt-fi, and Meshswap)

Benefits for FRAX holders

Higher return than any other DEX with high level of sustainability

Providing liquidity on Meshswap gives practical opportunities for FRAX community users to ensure higher yields than any other DEX protocol with great stability. In case of KLAYswap, paired pools consist of stable and major coins such as ETH-Tether show more than 10% in APR with high level of sustainability and zero risk in protocol level. In Meshswap, to be more specific, MESH (governance token in Meshswap) reward is given to liquidity providers of major assets (ETH, MATIC, USDT, refer that as A class asset). And one of the cooperative agenda that our team has discussed with the FRAX team is to classify FRAX as A class asset in Meshswap, which enables FRAX to mine MESH inflation reward when pairing with other A class assets.

There are two characteristics that can secure a higher level of yield than any other DEX protocol when providing liquidity in Meshswap.

It is not difficult to take up a large share in liquidity at the new platform and a large share would lead to higher return

Since MESH is a fair launch case (Per block issuing model) which would show very little supply in the initial stage, which leads to higher yield

Active transaction volume in the initial stages, which also leads to a higher APR in AMM system

Gaining governance power with mined MESH

Meshswap is the community-driven DEX. Its native token “MESH” is the governance token that offers the opportunity for users to determine the yield rate of the protocol through our special pool voting as well as governance voting.

Basically, MESH Stakers lock up their MESH in a certain period and earn MESH, and liquidity pool voting rights (vMESH) in return. Using vMESH, Stakers can vote on specific liquidity pools to allocate more MESH rewards and receive the distributed transaction fees incurred in the voted pool. Furthermore, as stakers are one of the most active contributors to the Meshswap ecosystem, they earn additional token airdrop rewards such as Drops and Ecopot. $MESH Staker can directly decide which liquidity pool to allocate more $MESH through votes.

By utilizing this feature, FRAX holders can vote on FRAX-related pair pools in order to increase a yield for the pair and get profit at the same time with vMESH.

Leverage farming

Meshswap has a leverage feature called single/plus deposit just like KLAYswap. Assets that users deposit in a single pool are leveraged by plus pool deposit. Merits of single deposit is that users can earn a high level of interest just by depositing a single asset. Assets used in single deposit service are major assets that show a sizable amount of liquidity around many other exchanges such as ETH, USDT, XRP, and etc. On the other hand, plus deposit users can borrow assets from a single deposit and earn multiple yields than normal pair deposit in AMM.

FRAX is one of the major stable coins with abundant growth potential. However, for the leverage system to work, there must be enough liquidity within Meshswap in order to avoid any unexpected liquidation risk. We would very much like to onboard FRAX on a single and plus deposit system once the pre-condition is met.

MESH Tokenomics

Once Meshswap officially launches, full-scale yield farming will begin. Daily MESH Inflation will be distributed to the entire ecosystem daily at the same rate accordingly:

Farm (80%): It is for lenders, general/Leverage farmers, and stakers in Meshswap protocol. vKSP Holder (5%): It is for core Klayswap users to encourage the circulation of blockchain ecosystems in the long term.

Development (5%): It is for the continuous technology development and maintenance Treasury

Treasury (5%): It is the business fund for emergencies and the future Meshswap ecosystem development.

Strategic Partner (5%): It is the incentive fund for potential Polygon Dapp partners

1. Official FRAX listing on DDDX. io under FRAX-USDC pair

With an official listing, FRAX-USDC can be easily accessed.

Start liquidity is required on DDDX platform- $5,000,000 in FRAX and $5,000,000 in USDC

The liquidity will be kept in the FRAX-USDC pair, which will be considered as a safety measure and add the trust of users, good for long-term users growth.

Frax Finance users will enjoy the lowest platform fee of 0.01% to swap for FRAX.

DDDX platform has a better stablecoin algorithm and governance model than Curve, will make the slippage of the FRAX-USDC lower, to help the FRAX swap price more stable and accurate.

2. DDDX tokens airdrop for Frax team & community members:

In tokenomics the initial total supply is 3,000,000 DDDX.

To start the partnership with Frax, 150,000 DDDX tokens (5% of the total supply ) will be shared to you in the form of veNFTs: -For Frax team： 40% (60,000 DDDX) -For Frax community members：60% (90,000DDDX) through random airdrops to 1000 users who hold ≥50,000 FRAX in their wallet. FCFS.

When Frax team and the community members get the veNFTs airdrop, they can vote for FRAX-USDC trading pair.

With these important votes, the FRAX-USDC pool will generate DDDX emission rewards, which will be sent to motivate the liquidity providers.

The Voters for FRAX-USDC can get the transaction fee and Bribe rewards of the trading pair.

3. Creating FXS Bribes Plan for 28 days.

Frax provides a Bribes plan for 4 weeks, sharing $ 40,000 of FXS per week, to reward the users who vote for the FRAX-USDC trading pair.

Providing bribes will attract more users to vote for this trading pair.

And with the votes, the trading pair will get more DDDX tokens emissions, thus will attract more liquidity providers to add liquidity to FRAX-USDC, and will bring more interest to your token.

The sum of the bribes should be $ 160,000 of FXS.

4. Others

Adding DDDX on the Frax Staking page: https://dddx.io/

Cross-marketing on Twitter & Discord

The DDDX protocol will be very glad to consider any potential integration in Frax Finance projects.

About DDDX. io

DDDX. io is a DEX 2.0 platform for stable currency swaps. With the new AMM algorithm it achieves extremely low slippage and a 0.01% fee rate. Similar to Curve Finance, DDDX. io is also a community-led DEX platform that supports veToken governance (voting escrow tokenomics ) and ve(3,3) tokenomics.

Currently deployed on BNB Chain, DDDX. io plans to deploy & launch on Ethereum. Based on this, DDDX. io hopes to invite Frax as one of the Ethereum ecological partners to participate in the launch and the protocol governance.

DDDX protocol has done many optimizations and upgrades on the basis of the Solidly protocol launched by AC, and has a better economic model and transaction experience than Solidly. As we witnessed when Solidly was first deployed on Fantom, it has brought more than $ 2 billion of TVL to FTM, bringing impressive liquidity to the 20 protocol partners who have wisely participated in the governance.

We believe that the deployment of DDDX on Ethereum will also bring benefits to our partners, bring Frax more exposure and liquidity, and boost the growth of Frax.

This proposal aims to strengthen the previously established partnership between Sifchain and FRAX as well as offer the FRAX community a good investment opportunity. If it passes, the FXS equivalent of $2,000,000, and $6,000,000 of Frax liquidity will be used to provide liquidity on Sifchain, bringing the total amount of liquidity provisions from the Frax treasury to $10,000,000 (2 Million dollars of FXS | 8 Million dollars of Frax).

Deep Liquidity on Sifchain will establish a gateway into the Cosmos ecosystem for FXS, make FXS transferable over IBC, and eventually enable FXS to be used as collateral in margin trading positions against any token bridged to by Sifchain’s omni-EVM bridge. The additional liquidity provisions from Frax will generate sizable rewards for the Frax treasury, and garner more voting power on the Sifchain network.

Introduction

My name is Tungkhan from SifDAO, the DAO that operates Sifchain. Two months ago SifDAO made a proposal to Frax to bring FRAX liquidity to Sifchain. The proposal passed with great community enthusiasm and SifDAO matched the liquidity provided by Frax, bringing the TVL of the pool to $5,000,000.

As of the date of this writing (April 27th), the $2,000,000 provided by FRAX 2 months ago has generated ~$675,000 worth of ROWAN (Sifchain’s token) rewards, or an ROI of ~34%. We are looking to further build upon our partnership with the Frax community by bringing FXS to the DEX as well.

About Sifchain:

Sifchain is a Cosmos SDK built DEX. Our primary value proposition is that we will enable capital efficient cross-chain trading through two features: omni-EVM and deep margin. Other interesting aspects of Sifchain include our use of slip-based swap fees, eventual order-book implementation, governance driven monetary policy, and having ROWAN as a base pair for all pools.

Omni-EVM: Sifchain aims to be the first Omni-Chain DEX, connecting to 20–25 blockchains for cross-chain integration. The targeted blockchains represent the overwhelming majority of all cryptocurrency trading volume - thus actively traded assets from all chains will be accessed through the Sifchain DEX. Omni-EVM will enable any ERC20 token, any Cosmos Token, and any token that exists on ANY EVM compatible blockchain to be imported and traded in Sifchain.

Deep Margin: Hopefully coming as soon as Q3, Sifchain will deploy its novel architecture for margin trading - allowing traders to use leverage on their trades by borrowing from the liquidity pool. The interest rate is set based on market demand and liquidity supply. Liquidity providers are able to add liquidity into Sifchain’s pools symmetrically or asymmetrically, while MEV front-running in order placements is prevented through a commitment-reveal scheme.

Deep Margin + Omni-EVM: Any ERC20 token or Cosmos Network token will be able to be used as collateral in any margin trading position. Likewise, any such token can be longed or shorted. This unlocks nearly unlimited margin trading pairs and enables users to utilize this feature on tokens that have previously never been possible.

Technical details:

Following the standards outlined in [Bridge Mechanism - Frax Finance ¤ 2], FXS on Sifchain will not be the canonical representation of FXS, and as such it will be called sifFXS when traveling over IBC (Cosmos’s Inter-blockchain Communication Protocol).

An Investment Opportunity – Historical Metrics:

The partnership between FRAX and Sifchain resulted in the first liquidity provision from the Frax treasury of $2 million FRAX into the FRAX:ROWAN pool on March 2nd, 2022.

On-chain data showed that, on 27th April (at 12h30 GMT time), FRAX was providing $2.37 million of liquidity to the FRAX:ROWAN pool and staking $307k with Sifchain’s validator nodes. The total USD value of FRAX’s wallet was $2.675 million, making a profit of $675k over nearly 2 months or a ROI of ~34%.

This ROI is among the highest rates across DEXes throughout all cryptocurrencies. Many believe that these high ROIs are unsustainable, and we concur, which is why inflation is being reduced weekly in accordance with Sifchain’s long-term economic plans. Despite high APRs & inflation, by looking at ROWAN’s price over the past 3 months we find that it has performed remarkably well. It has not only been stable but even was one of the highest gainers on April 26rd. Its price rose by ~40% in two weeks when the rest of the market was going down.

Potential Landscape ahead:

On April 19th, 2022, we deployed the PMTP (Protocol Monetary Trade Policy) mechanism which aims to control ROWAN’s purchasing power, making it a valuable asset to hold, earn and stake. This breakthrough invention in DeFi will mark the beginnings of a new era because it gives SifDAO fine-tuned control over ROWAN’s monetary policy. Alongside the launch of PMTP we are dramatically reducing inflation, and have just deployed a new liquidity mining module which complements PMTP by allowing a flexible emissions schedule. Furthermore, the new liquidity mining module auto-compounds rewards back into the pool, creating continuously deeper pools and maximizing the Frax community’s returns with little effort.

We expect the release of Peggy 2, an omni-evm bridge by the end of Q2, and margin trading sometime in Q3. All of these novel features are expected to make ROWAN value held by FRAX communities a lot higher than it is currently. We are excited to inform you that today our TVL reached its ATH of $148 million, a ~200% gain from the last 2 months.

With all these facts in hand, we make a proposal for more FXS:ROWAN liquidity on Sifchain and believe this timely investment will further strengthen the partnership between FRAX-Sifchain, while bringing many benefits to the frax community.

Proposal Result:

For: Use $2,000,000 (2 million dollars) of FXS liquidity & $6,000,000 (6 million dollars) of FRAX from the treasury to provide liquidity on Sifchain

Against: Do nothing

Remove FRAX-SUSHI gauge so the pool stops receiving FXS.

As pointed out by community members, SUSHI-FRAX liquidity pool is relatively small in terms of TVL and participation in 24h volume of FRAX transactions. Also, this gauge oddly incentivizes staking SUSHI more than staking ETH or even FXS.

We would like to propose removing the gauge from FXS as this essentially allows stable pools and other FRAX/FXS/FPI/FPIS-focused pools to gain more rewards. Also, FXS emission would be used more efficiently for the stability of FRAX as well as the extension of the market cap of that.

This is somewhat of an unusual proposal and it will also be used as a way to test community sentiment on having FXS receiving gauges on pools that source their yield from FXS.

Implementation:

We will set the farm reward to 0 for SUSHI-FRAX pool and people can withdraw from the farm afterward.

Summary

Create a Goldfinch AMO to provide liquidity to the Goldfinch Senior Pool, which will earn Frax non-crypto correlated yield and provide Goldfinch with capital to deploy in new Borrower Pools.

Background

As Frax grows, it becomes increasingly important that its collateral mix diversifies into safe yield assets with interest rate revenues coming from non-crypto correlated economic activity.

Goldfinch is a decentralized credit protocol that has been designed from the ground up to do exactly this – bringing off-chain yields on-chain at scale. Read more about Goldfinch below.

About Goldfinch

Goldfinch is a decentralized credit protocol with a mission to expand access to capital and foster financial inclusion. We believe all of private credit markets will move on chain in the coming decade, and Goldfinch will be the marketplace for all of that activity. The protocol provides structured products that enables borrowers around the world to access dollar-denominated stablecoins to put to use in the real world.

The returns for lenders on Goldfinch are uncorrelated with the rest of crypto as borrowed capital is put to use in real-world use cases (not traders or MM’s).

As a lender, there are two options. You can choose to actively assess loans and earn higher yields by supplying first-loss capital as junior tranche Backers, or passively invest in an index of low-risk senior tranche loans as Liquidity Providers. Frax would do the latter.

Goldfinch Metrics

Live on-chain stats can be found here 3, with some key metrics: $115M TVL $100M+ in active loans

0% in loan defaults. $100k/mo in recurring USDC treasury revenue

About the Goldfinch Senior Pool / FIDU

The Goldfinch Senior Pool represents a diversified senior position on all outstanding loans on Goldfinch. When Liquidity Providers (LPs) supply to the Senior Pool, they receive an equivalent amount of FIDU, which is an ERC-20 token. At any time, Liquidity Providers can withdraw by redeeming their FIDU for USDC at an exchange rate based on the net asset value of the Senior Pool, minus a 0.5% withdrawal fee. This exchange rate for FIDU increases over time as interest payments are made back to the Senior Pool (similar to how Compound cTokens work).

Returns

Variable returns

Historically between ~4.5-9%

Currently ~8%

More data can be found on our Dune dashboard

Liquidity

Like Compound, liquidity is highly likely, but not guaranteed.

There is a 0.5% withdrawal fee to prevent certain flash loan attacks, and to incentivize longer term capital (break even time would be about 3 weeks at current rates)

Risks / Structure / Protections

As the name implies, each investment from the Senior Pool is senior to the Backers who supply “junior” capital. Some important considerations

There is typically 20-25% of junior “buffer” in each deal. This means that 20-25% of the principal would need to be lost before the Senior Pool loses any money.

Each loan itself is fully or over collateralized with off-chain assets or income. This varies from loan to loan, but they will either be senior secured to other lenders, or be backed with assets (such as the underlying loans) worth over 100% of the loan value. This effectively means that borrowers often provide 10-15% of equity capital that is junior even to the Backers.

All the Backers (usually dozens in a given deal) sign legal contracts with the borrower. They have recourse to go after a borrower in case of default.

Legal contracts stipulate that borrowers must pay into the smart contracts, and the smart contracts enforce that the Senior Pool is paid first. So the Senior Pool is naturally protected with legal recourse by the Backers own interests.

Incentives

There is currently a liquidity mining program incentivizing FIDU purchase. Staking your FIDU will earn you the Goldfinch governance token (GFI).

GFI incentive adds ~14% APY at current prices (~$2.50/token)

Note that rate assumes you hold for 12 months. Holding for less time will decrease the rate linearly (eg. 6 months is half the rate)

There is a proposal to remove the vesting period currently live on Goldfinch governance

Underlying Borrowers

The Borrowers on Goldfinch are generally fintech lending companies, primarily (~80%) in emerging markets. These borrowers all use technology in some way to have an edge in their lending.

One example is PayJoy, who does smart phone financing, and has special software installed on the phones so that if someone doesn’t pay, their phone shuts off. Another is Tugende who finances rent-to-own motorcycles for gig economy drivers in Kenya.

In America, borrowers include Braavo, a data-driven accounts receivable company.

Importantly, a distribution channel for these deals is credit funds. Those funds originate and underwrite deals, then syndicating them out to the Goldfinch community of backers.

Goldfinch borrowers exist in over 18 different countries, giving the loans geographic, regulatory, and monetary policy diversity. All past deals are viewable on the Goldfinch dapp.

Goldfinch AMO

We propose creating a Goldfinch AMO that invests into the Goldfinch Senior Pool. This would generate yield for Frax that is uncorrelated with the rest of crypto, while providing liquidity for Goldfinch to allocate towards loans. We propose the authorization of up to $100m worth of liquidity for use in the AMO.

How Does This Benefit Frax?

Grow the treasury with safe, attractive yield that is truly uncorrelated with the rest of the crypto markets. No market makers or crypto traders or wild leverage here. Just real economic growth from nearly two dozen countries.

Low governance overhead. - The Senior Pool is a perpetual and scalable. New deals are constantly being added and paid back. The size of the pool will keep growing, and the assessment is not with one particular fund manager, but more the broader community who will continue to bring on many amazing borrowers.

Diversified and scalable by default - The Senior Pool is not one fund manager. There is no cap on the fund size. It is composed of many companies and many funds, automatically scaling with the Goldfinch protocol, and continually diversified across all of them, without any new actions required.

First, thank you for approving our first proposal. We took into account the reviews from Frax community members that our first proposal was not very detailed, and here is an updated version of Lend Flare first proposal.

Summary:

Create a new partnership between Frax and Lend Flare by:

Integrating Frax as a supplied asset on Lend Flare, which will create a new yield opportunity for Frax stablecoin holders and allow loans of Frax against most Curve LP on Lend Flare.

Doing co-marketing (Twitter AMA, shared documentation, joint Medium article, mutual communication inside both communities).

The problem Lend Flare aims to solve:

More than a dex, Curve can be seen as a liquidity reserve or somehow a DeFi saving account. At the moment, this liquidity earns a yield composed of curve rewards and trading fees.

Nevertheless, there are few additional opportunities for curve LP holders to take advantage of this huge liquidity, especially with low risk and high flexibility. Lend Flare provides a solution to this problem.

A quick presentation of Lend Flare:

Lend Flare is a decentralized borrowing platform on Ethereum blockchain.

Its added value is to allow Curve LP holders (the borrowers) to draw fixed-rate, fixed-term, and high LTV loans against Curve LP used as collateral, with no concerns for assets being liquidated due to price fluctuation.

Liquidity providers (the lenders) who deposit loan liquidity for borrowers on Lend Flare receive in exchange a share of loan fees and an incentive in LFT token (Lend Flare governance token) for their participation. LFT tokenomics follow the curve ve-model, with a fair launch (no seed rounds, team get only 2% of max supply with a 2-year linear vesting).

Why is Lend Flare interested in a partnership with Frax?

As part of its core strategy, Lend Flare already proposes to its borrowers a large selection of curve LPs, including the fraxCrv (frax+3crv) pool. But, at the moment, only USDC, DAI, wBTC, ETH can be borrowed against curve LPs. Lend Flare wants to integrate different supplied assets mainly for three reasons:

Stay at the forefront of innovation in DeFi, by proposing new products seen as robust, like Frax.

Diversify our supplied assets with a view to minimizing risks

Offer more choices to users according to their personal preference

Frax stablecoin as a supplied asset fits these 3 criterias, and it’s the main reason for its integration and our partnership proposal.

Moreover, with the upcoming launch of Lend Flare V2 and V3 ( especially the launch of Lend Flare synthetic stablecoin), we also have in mind other use cases for Frax in Lend Flare that can enrich Lend Flare new features. This can be discussed later in another proposal, with more technical details.

How can Frax benefit from a partnership with Lend Flare?

Lend Flare is a low risk, high LTV borrowing platform. By allowing Frax as a supplied asset, Lend Flare creates new use cases for Frax stablecoin. With Lend Flare growth, it’s reasonable to expect growth in Frax adoption on Lend Flare too.

By creating a Lend Flare supply pool for Frax stablecoin, it creates a yield opportunity for Frax holders who are willing to provide liquidity. At the moment, there are plenty of opportunities with usdt/usdc/dai, but to our knowledge much less with Frax stablecoin. Lend Flare can help fill this gap.

Frax suppliers could expect similar yields, depending on their locked LFT amounts. With Lend Flare fair tokenomics (low vesting continuous-release, low-medium inflation), we hope that this opportunity will be sustainable in the long run.

Frax could be borrowed up to 85% LTV on Lend Flare, with all curve LPs as collateral, and especially frax3crv as collateral. Potentially, this will lead to an increase in the number of Frax users.

Frax could be borrowed up to 85% LTV on Lend Flare, with all curve LPs as collateral, and especially frax3crv as collateral. Potentially, this will lead to an increase in the number of Frax users.

Besides, after the V2 release, for all curve LPs deposited on Lend Flare, and so frax3crv, CRV and CVX rewards are going to be automatically compounded. Hence, Frax3crv holders will receive a reward boost up to 50%.

As said in the answer to the previous question, Lend Flare V2 and V3 will bring new features, and if frax community becomes confident about Lend Flare platform, the partnership between the two protocols could evolve according to our mutual interest.

Concerning our past proposal:

The last two points inside our last proposal (frax-lft token swap, Curve pool with Frax/Lend Flare synthetic asset) is what Lend Flare team aims for in the near future, after the integration of Frax as a supplied asset.

At the moment, with the upcoming releases of Lend Flare V2 and Curve 4pool, we would like to focus more on raising awareness between Lend Flare and Frax communities, before submitting another proposal with all the necessary technical details (like the borrow interest model for frax stablecoin, initial frax funding …). So here is below our updated proposal.

Our updated proposal:

Integration of Frax as a supplied asset on Lend Flare.

A Frax Medium article, co-written, on how to supply Frax and frax3crv on Lend Flare.

Continuous interactions directly with both communities, on Discord/Telegram, by sharing and discussing updates about both protocols.

Summary

Deprecate the buyback() and recollateralize() functions and instead use TWAMMs to expand/contract the FRAX supply and/or burn FXS through a TWAMM AMO.

Background

Since FRAX v1, the protocol has had 2 functions (buyback() & recollateralize()) to hit the target CR by either buying back and burning FXS for USDC or minting FXS for USDC. These functions allow anyone to swap collateral (USDC) to/from the protocol at the Chainlink oracle price of FXS. These functions serve to make sure the amount of collateral the protocol has match the target collateral ratio either by using excess collateral to burn FXS and matching the CR or by minting FXS to taken in USDC to raise the CR to target.

Documentation can be seen here: https://docs.frax.finance/fxs-buybacks-and-recollateralization

These functions essentially serve the purpose of either increasing or decreasing the collateral held on the balance sheet to make sure the CR is properly on target.

With the advent of Fraxswap and TWAMMs, these swaps can be done in as decentralized and permissionless of a manner through an AMO contract that sets up TWAMMs for the appropriate assets. This is one of the main use cases that Fraxswap was  in fact built for.

Documentation for Fraxswap TWAMMs can be found at: https://docs.frax.finance/fraxswap/technical-specifications

Proposal

Permanently deprecate the above functions to perform the same monetary policy through a TWAMM AMO and Fraxswap buy/sell orders of TWAMMs. This has the same trust assumptions and monetary policy effects but is more capital efficient, useful, and helps bring more trading activity+usage of Fraxswap, our native AMM.

Summary: Approve Pitch to stake FXS from a smart contract and establish a gauge for pitchFXS/Frax

Background & Motivation

Pitch is a new project that builds governance tooling, offering increased yield and utility for token holders and greater security to DAOs at large. https://pitch.money

Pitch is currently known for its vote-incentives application, which has processed seven figures of rewards to date. The application fixed many well-known bugs in bribe.crv.finance’s original implementation while introducing the notion of “elastic rewards”, where protocols specify the precise price-per-vote they will pay for a gauge vote. This creates a novel mechanism for governance price discovery and helps de-risk protocols from wasting their community budget.

However, one Pitch’s largest shortcomings so far is its inability to auto-compound historical rewards. This is due to the fundamental architecture of veFXS and cannot be solved without introducing a new paradigm in governance management.

It’s fundamentally impossible in the current paradigm for users to simultaneously: ● Engage in FXS governance (and/or capture related yield) ● Leverage their FXS holdings via lending and other financial instruments ● Have liquidity

Pitch can fix this problem, and the solution is fully discussed in the governance forum linked above. Whitelisting Pitch as a veFXS staker with a pitchFXS liquid token and gauge (which requires periodic lockups to actively vote) is all that's needed for this to launch.

Summary

Create a TrueFi AMO to provide liquidity directly to the TrueFi Protocol

About TrueFi

TrueFi was DeFi’s first uncollateralized lending protocol. TrueFi aims to be the leading protocol allowing Asset Managers (we call them “portfolio managers”) to run lending strategies on-chain. Apart from already-proven lending strategies to crypto-native institutions, TrueFi is actively working with 3rd party Portfolio Managers who are interested in running their strategies on our protocol.

We are aiming to bridge the gap between RWA and DeFi and provide a platform where RWA originators can access crypto capital.

Since TrueFi’s launch in November 2020

The protocol has originated ~$1.4bn in uncollateralized loans across 121 loans and ~35 borrowers with 0 defaults.

The protocol currently supports USDC, USDT, TUSD, and BUSD and offers loans ranging from 30 to 180 days.

Average borrower rates (without token incentives) are roughly 9.5% with a range from 7.16% - 18%.

Total interest generated between November 2020 and today is 19.32mm USD

Background and Motivation

Stablecoins (such as FRAX) are money-printing machines that have the potential to completely alter how we think about capital deployment and the cost of capital within the crypto markets. TrueFi has proven itself to be a reliable source of yield for crypto lenders and would like to partner with FRAX as a source of reliable revenue for the protocol.

For this first AMO, the idea is to generate yield for FRAX while also tapping into a new source of liquidity for TrueFi (win/win situation). Longer-term there are a number of additional partnership opportunities that we could pursue:

Given our large base of trading and market-making firms along with TrueFi’s plans for L2 expansion, we can help to create market-maker-focused lending pools to increase FRAX liquidity on L2s.

In addition, we will be onboarding several RWA-type lending opportunities over the coming months and if FRAX would like exposure to those types of opportunities, we are happy to present those, as well.

For the initial proposal, we will seek USDC and FRAX liquidity. For USDC, we have several products that FRAX could deposit the USDC into, including our permissionless pools. We also have products such as an “Alameda single-borrower pool” where Alameda is the only borrower in the pool. For FRAX liquidity, we would aim to create a new FRAX pool where we will have many of the same market makers on the platform borrowing FRAX. Once approved, we will work with the FRAX team to decide on the optimal pool/portfolio to deposit the funds into based on FRAX's preference for yield/risk/duration.

Excited for the opportunity to partner!

Create a TrueFi AMO and authorize up to $100m worth of liquidity for use in the AMO ($50mm in USDC, $50mm in FRAX).

C2tP (Convex Finance)

Summary

Add the new FPI/FRAX Curve v2 pool as a wrapped Convex staking position to the Gauge Controller to increase FPI liquidity via CRV, CVX, and FXS rewards.

Background & Motivation

With the release of FPI, we should look at adding incentives so that FPI is suitably liquid. The recent FPI/FRAX Curve pool has recently passed its governance proposal to be added to their Gauge Controller( https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/166

1) and will begin to receive CRV rewards, and subsequently CVX rewards.

We can use a wrapped staking position on Convex to create an erc20 token that receives CRV and CVX. This token can then be staked on a Frax Finance gauge to then also receive FXS rewards.

The FPI pool should be a main target for incentives as keeping FPI with ample liquidity should be a protocol goal.

This will accumulate multiple rewards from multiple protocols into one position and vastly grow the pool size.

The wrapped staking position itself will be an unmanaged trustless position. An example of this wrapper can be found being used on Abracadabra and on our github (platform/contracts/contracts/wrappers at main · convex-eth/platform · GitHub 2).

Create a wrapped Convex position for the FPI/FRAX pool and add it to the Frax Finance Gauge Controller.

Summary

Create a Thetanuts AMO to provide liquidity directly to Thetanuts’ options vaults.

Background and Motivation

Thetanuts is a multi-chain crypto derivatives platform, offering organic yield opportunities for users and daos alike to earn sustainable returns. Options markets are still in their infancy with only $1 billion in TVL while spot dex’s have nearly $70 billion in TVL. In traditional markets, derivatives such as options are anywhere between 8x-20x more liquid than their spot counterparts. There will be several catalysts needed for the same to happen with options markets in DeFi, but one necessary component will be having sufficient liquidity. Frax is in a unique position to supply the capital necessary for Thetanuts’ vaults given its proven record of stability, cooperation, and innovating protocol design. A collaboration with Thetanuts would lead to increased demand for Frax while improving the TVL of Thetanuts.

In this collaboration, Frax will be deployed in Thetanuts version one index product to sell a variety of puts (example, eth puts and wbtc puts) that aggregate to a single index token. This enables Frax holders to generate outsized risk adjusted base yields in Frax, resulting from top market makers such as Alameda, QCP Capital, Ledgerprime, Genesis, GSR, and Wintermute actively participating in Thetanuts option vaults.

This product differentiates Thetanuts from its peers and benefits Frax holders because:

Thetanuts creates a high yield risk adjusted scenario estimated at ~50% for 2021 via its index because users are no longer seeing their risk concentrated on a single strike and tenor. This can be observed from the back test.

Thetanuts does not take fees on its base vaults. This ensures that Frax holders continue to receive the highest base yield in the DeFi options space.

Thetanuts index product will be multichain unlike current defi option vaults which are available for access only on their source chain creating a superior user experience.

Additionally as the collaboration grows, Frax will gain traction as a standard for settlement in the dealing of financial derivatives. Thetanuts benefits as it is able to build out a comprehensive options market by having vaults on varying strikes and tenors for various assets. This would be a critical step in creating a full service decentralized options trading platform. For these reasons, a collaboration between Frax and Thetanuts will be mutually fruitful.

Official FRAX listing on Biswap under FRAX-BUSD pair

While every token FRAX is traded on Biswap once a liquidity pool is created, users are met with a caution message of an imported token. With an official listing, FRAX-BUSD can be easily accessed through a token search. Over time FRAX will also be included in the Fee Return promotion, letting users gain up to 90% fee return in BSW.

For the FRAX official listing is required the start liquidity on Biswap - is $1 000 000 in FRAX and $1 000 000 in BUSD for the FRAX-BUSD pair.

In case Biswap is considered as the main DEX on BSC for Frax Finance, the liquidity will be kept in the FRAX-BUSD pair. Biswap is open to using any liquidity lockers by the Frax Finance team, it will be additional trust and security points for the community

Frax Finance users will have the opportunity to buy FRAX with the lowest platform fee of 0.1%

Adding Biswap on the Frax Integrations page

Potential creation of Stake FRAX-BNB LP - Earn BSW Farm

Biswap Farms allow users to stake FRAX-BNB LP tokens and get BSW rewards for staking. It will increase the number of long-term FRAX holders, as well as increase liquidity to provide lower slippage.

Along with participation in Farms, liquidity providers get 0.05% of all swaps made inside the trading pair as a fee reward.

Once FRAX trading volumes on Biswap grow and achieve significant average daily trading volumes (through several days) Biswap will consider the creation of Stake FRAX-BNB LP - Earn BSW Farm.

Other factors that may impact Farm creation include the project’s community health, security issues, roadmap release postponement, and implementation of other agreement points.

Farming pairs on Biswap are reconsidered on a monthly basis depending on their trading volumes.

Existing Farms on Biswap could be found here: https://biswap.org/farms

Creating the Stake BSW | Earn FRAX Launchpool for 30 days that will spread FRAX tokens among more than 125 000+ BSW holders. Biswap Launchpools allow users to earn crypto for holding BSW. Providing liquidity on Biswap Launchpools will increase your target audience among Biswappers and investors. That will bring more interest to your token, increase its trustworthiness, and boost the number of holders.

The required sum is $100 000 in FRAX for Stake BSW | Earn FRAX Unlimited Launchpool (30 days).

Author: On behalf of the Citadel DAO community

Introduction

Citadel is a treasury DAO aiming to be the largest community owned Bitcoin position in the world. The treasury and protocol will be governed by the CTDL token, with a predominant Bitcoin treasury actively earning yield and shared with long term CTDL holders. Citadel DAO is a sub DAO to Badger.

It will leverage unique funding mechanics to accelerate the continuous growth of its treasury while using the power of BadgerDAO’s tried and tested vault strategies to optimize its yield.

To ensure it can create sustainable yield on its Bitcoin positions it will hold not only Bitcoin (+ BTC LP’s), but also yield influence assets across DeFi (eg. CVX, FXS and BADGER). This enables Citadel to wield large influence across multiple ecosystems and fight for Bitcoin to get the yield it deserves.

To better understand how Citadel works, CTDL token mechanics and elastic emissions, review Citadel DAO’s tokenomic deep dive article here https://thecitadeldao.medium.com/tokenomics-deep-dive-a11e7f5e2083

For a comprehensive overview of all the details of Citadel DAO please review our introduction article: https://thecitadeldao.medium.com/introducing-the-citadel-dao-551849104d26

CTDL Launch Event

Citadel DAO’s goal is to have a completely fair and transparent launch while distributing ownership of CTDL to not only users that participate early but to a select group of DAO’s/dapps across our ecosystem, that align with the core values of Citadel. Their alignment and vested interest will accelerate Citadel’s ability to effectively deploy its treasury to benefit all participants in the ecosystem.

We call this launch the Citadel Knighting Round.

Over the course of multiple days users will be able to swap BTC and yield influence assets for xCTDL.

Only users who qualify for the whitelist can participate in the launch event. The whitelist selection criteria will be based on a combination of actions users have taken in the Badger ecosystem and in our partners dapps, like Frax. The group of partners/knights have been revealed over the last month and consists of;

Frax

Convex

Redacted

Ren

TRIBE

Alchemix

Tokemak

JonesDAO

All of the Citadel Knights are also whitelisted to participate in the launch event themselves, leveraging their treasuries.

The current launch event details being discussed amongst Citadel DAO community members are as follows;

Round 1 (Core Treasury Boostrap): Uncapped, whitelist participants only, open to bribes, fixed price of $21/CTDL

Accepted assets: WBTC, bibbtc/sbtc (ibbtc Badger vault token), ETH, FRAX, USDC

Assets will be rebalanced post launch to reflect the Citadel DAO policy teams ideal treasury composition for optimizing yield and BTC exposure

Round 2 (Yield Influence) : Capped (amount TBD), no whitelist, no bribes, fixed price of $25/CTDL

Accepted assets: Badger and CVX

For a detailed breakdown of CTDL token distribution and launch event please refer back to the discussion thread on the governance forum: https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-54-frax-citadel-bringing-btc-to-frax/1192

This launch event is the ONLY distribution of CTDL tokens. There were no prior investment rounds, private or public.

Proposal

Frax DAO participates in Round 1 of launch

To further align the two DAO’s, introduce BTC backing to FRAX, accelerate FRAX’s yield influence and support the growth of 4pool on Curve, we’re proposing FRAX DAO participates in the initial launch event using protocol capital. This is at the same fixed price as the whitelisted users from partner communities and the only distribution of pre-protocol launch CTDL.

To gain community wide sentiment, we’re proposing 3 different participation amounts for the purpose of deciding the adequate allocation collectively; $21M ($16M in FRAX & $5M in FXS) @$21 per CTDL = 1,000,000 CTDL $15M ($12M in FRAX & $3M in FXS) @$21 per CTDL = 714,285 CTDL $11M ($9M in FRAX & $2M in FXS) @$21 per CTDL = 523,809 CTDL

What will Citadel DAO do with the FRAX & FXS?

Create deep liquidity for BTC/4 Pool on Curve

Citadel will pair the FRAX provided with WBTC from its treasury (in a new wbtc/4pool) and provide liquidity for the Curve v2 pool it intends to launch. Today most of the volume of BTC <> stablecoins on Curve goes through the tricrypto pool. Introducing deep liquidity for the 4pool against BTC, will provide additional utility for FRAX and alternative routes for swapping with BTC on Curve. This is, of course, contingent on the creation and gauge approval for 4pool – if the gauge is not approved, Citadel DAO could create a wbtc/frax pool instead to execute the same strategy.

Outside of providing liquidity, Citadel DAO will support yield on this pool through its Convex farming strategy. Using its potentially large CVX position along with bribing, Citadel DAO will push vote weight to optimize the CRV and CVX rewards allocated to this pool via bi-weekly Curve/Convex gauge votes. This will not only help with the wbtc/4pool, but also the overall adoption of 4pool across DeFi.

To optimize the returns and increase influence for Citadel leveraging this pool, Badger will design a custom LP vault (wbtc/4pool) that participates both in Convex and FXS ecosystems. This vault strategy will allow Citadel to earn more CVX (locked) to influence the yield on this pool, grow liquidity, lock more FXS and support the cvxFXS peg, while creating a flywheel to redistribute BTC to CTDL lockers (which FRAX could be one of the largest).

Become a long term locker of FXS and gauge system supporter

Citadel DAO will max lock the FXS received for veFXS. Assuming a FXS gauge approval for bwbtc/4pool (Badger vault token) and protocol whitelisting, Citadel DAO will use its vote weight to drive additional yield in the form of FXS. It will then use that FXS to support the cvxFXS peg and lock more as veFXS.

This further aligns Citadel DAO with FRAX as both would be large participants in each others protocols governance along with long term supporters.

Introduce BTC backing to FRAX

The launch of wbtc/4pool on Curve opens up a unique opportunity for Frax Finance to introduce BTC to the backing of FRAX. If Frax were to extend its existing Curve or Convex AMO to this pool, The protocol can use it to create additional peg stability and farm more CVX while increasing the backing of the LP (wbtc/4pool) for FRAX.

This is contingent on the Frax core team building out an AMO to support this, but in preliminary conversations this seems like something they are open to doing.

What does Frax get from this?

Frax will receive voted locked CTDL (vlCTDL) in exchange for their participation, which has a 21 week lock.

Holders of xCTDL will also have the option to LOCK their xCTDL for a fixed period of 7 epochs (each epoch is 3 weeks, so this amounts to 21 weeks). In return for locking xCTDL, lockers will receive the following additional rewards:

2x boost on CTDL emissions (for example, if a user was receiving 1% of CTDL emissions when staking xCTDL, they would receive 2% with vlCTDL).

Share of Funding revenue generated — paid out in BTC

Share of treasury yield — paid out in BTC

Governance rights to vote on whitelisting protocols for Citadel treasury deployment and which assets to accept for continuous funding (ie. allow for swapping to discounted xCTDL).

Frax would directly benefit from the yield being generated on the Citadel DAO treasury, which would consist of the FRAX and FXS received for participation. It will also receive a consistent flow of BTC into its own treasury that could be used to further grow the backing of BTC in the FRAX asset.

Frax would also have influence over how the treasury is deployed and which assets the treasury takes in. This is important for ensuring Citadel DAOs long term alignment with Frax.

Citadel + FRAX become a force TOGETHER

Together, Citadel and Frax can support yield on bitcoin, grow utility of FRAX, grow 4pool adoption, have another strategic partner in the Curve renaissance, and Frax can gain significant influence around one of the largest BTC treasuries in the world. On top of it all, FRAX will have a protocol committed to being a long term holder and participant of the FXS ecosystem.

Bribe to Earn More Influence

There is 5% of the entire CTDL supply allocated to partners of Citadel. By using the Hidden Hand platform from Redacted (currently supports Frax Hidden Hand 3 ) during the launch event, users can vote for 1 of the 8 partner DAO’s when participating in the sale. The more votes a partner DAO gets, the larger share of the 5% supply they will receive.

Separate from the proposed participation of $21, $15M or $11M, to gain a larger share of this pool, we propose a $2M ONE TIME bribe in the form of FXS that will go directly to users.

This would amplify all of the outlined benefits in the previous sections, as Frax would become an even larger vlCTDL holder increasing its overall yield in CTDL and BTC.

How will the participation and bribe amounts be executed?

Prior to the community sale, Frax DAO would send the approved participation amount in Frax and FXS to the Citadel DAO multisig, which is governed by its token holders and 5 signers. Citadel DAO would then send the Frax DAO multisig xCTDL at the time of token & protocol launch after the completion of the 2 community rounds. Frax would then lock that xCTDL as vlCTDL via the Citadel DAO smart contracts.

For the $2M FXS bribe, that would be handled exclusively through the Hidden Hands platform with no control by the Citadel DAO.

Proposal

TempleDAO made its name as an early backer of Frax Finance by conducting its presale exclusively with FRAX, and became a top FRAX holder with one of the largest FRAX reserves ($137M). Recently we have also started bribing on the Pitch.money platform to further evangelise the FRAX ecosystem. Now we plan to double down on our commitment by launching STAX Finance, which will enable users to easily zap into the TEMPLE/FRAX LP pair, TEMPLE vault strategies, and partake in other FRAX gauge yields in the future. By building a user-friendly interface to automate FRAX investments for investors to receive FXS yields and bribes from existing platforms such as Hidden Hands and Pitch, STAX aims to become the best place to stake into Frax gauges.

Since STAX lowers the barrier to gaining exposure to the Frax ecosystem while facilitating the accumulation and removal of FXS from circulation to drive demand, this deepening of our existing partnership would be a win-win for both protocols.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0xfb86bc1e4d1c1c7bbc6d0dfab24407fb56f3ea01b5f1ca801df11fdc8d1c0089

Proposal

Eternity invites FRAX to participate in the Eternity seed round as a protocol DAO. This round includes investments from PIF.vc.

FXS Holders benefit as a direct result since GLORY tokens would go toward diversifying the protocol balance sheet. To align incentives, we are committed to using FRAX-GLORY as our pair of choice and intend to apply for an FXS gauge in the future. We find that the Frax protocol is building the most robust monetary system in all of DeFi and seek to become positive-sum partners well into the future.

GLORY is the revenue-bearing asset and Eternity governance token. GLORY can be used to purchase items. GLORY is primarily rewarded in-game for completing significant challenges or special events and can be staked in exchange for experience potions - important consumables which can help level up Heroes. GLORY stakers also qualify for rare NFT airdrops, in-game achievements, and access to special challenges and Heroes. Finally, stakers receive voting rights on the future direction of game content and the grander story of Eternity.

Set up a relayer with 250K worth of FRAX tokens.

Set up and Fund a FRAX liquidity pool for 500k-750k

Background and Motivation

Across ( https://across.to/ ) is a token bridge built on Ethereum with L2-L1 on Arbitrum, Optimism, Boba and soon additional bridges and L2-L2 interoperability. Built from the team behind UMA, its unique implementation of relayers and liquidity pools allow it to boast itself as the fastest and cheapest bridge for token bridging.

The Ethereum ecosystem is currently plagued by high fees and usage is uneconomical for most participants. The rollup ecosystem (collectively known as L2s) is robust and growing immensely - its promise of scale and keeping transactions fees low means that they will eventually dominate usage over L1 mainnet and thus we need to think of the future where many (if not most) projects will be based on some of these L2 chains.

FRAX is currently ranked 6 on the Coingecko Stablecoins category with a market cap of about $2.9B, and is one of the largest decentralized algorithmic stablecoin projects on Ethereum behind DAI. To ensure its leadership position and to remain competitive, FRAX should become one of the most liquid assets on as many chains as possible. Complementary to other token bridging solutions, having FRAX be accessible across many different bridging platforms minimizes centralization risk.

This is where Across comes in - we plan to provide some of the necessary backend infrastructure to allow FRAX to be transferred quickly and as cheaply as possible across supported chains. Efficient and positive usage will allow Across to further its mission and deepen its relationship, and to scale up liquidity. In the near future, there will be potential to incentivize FRAX LP on Across which would further drive demand higher for FRAX.

Specification

To create a system for bridging FRAX using Across for fast, low cost bridging requires 2 components.

The first component is to set up a ‘relayer’. Risk Labs (UMA) would be working with the FRAX team to demonstrate how a relayer can be set up with the intent that the FRAX team will run the relayer themselves; alternatively, FRAX could lend 250k $FRAX to Risk Labs to run a relayer on behalf of the FRAX team. Risk Labs will not charge Frax Finance for any costs of running the relayer for at least 3 months.

The second component is the liquidity pool. This would constitute funding the liquidity pool with 500k-750k $FRAX as a reasonable amount to start with. If all goes well, we anticipate expanding significantly in a subsequent snapshot based on Across demand.

Example Transaction & Mechanics

Bob wants to move 100,000 FRAX from Arbitrum to Mainnet. He puts it into a deposit box in Arbitrum. The relayer sees that deposit and fronts the FRAX to him on Mainnet. After a 2hr dispute period, the relayer gets reimbursed by the FRAX LP on Mainnet. The FRAX LP gets reimbursed by sending the original FRAX from the Arbitrum deposit box through the canonical bridge back to Mainnet. So the relayer is doing 2-hr loans and the LP is doing 7-day loans. This is the reason why the relayer needs less funds. A relayer has to be able to support Frax’s largest single transfer whereas the LP needs to have enough liquidity to support 7 days of transfers.

Summary

To establish a partnership between Frax Finance and Lend Flare. This proposal could potential help Frax investors to unlock their assets without losing any interest and maximize their yield.

Background

Lend Flare is a decentralized borrowing platform on Ethereum blockchain that allows Curve LP holders (the borrowers) to draw fixed-rate, fixed term and high LTV loans against Curve LP used as collateral, with no concerns for assets being liquidated due to price fluctuation. Loans are paid out through Lend Flare from Compound platform. Liquidity providers (the lenders) who deposit loan liquidity through Lend Flare on Compound platform will receive one of the highest interest rate compared to other current lending platforms.

Motivation

Frax has recently become one of the most influential stable coin in the market. Currently around 2876m sitting in Curve gauge. With Lend Flare, frax3crv holders can collacterize their assets in Lend Flare and borrow other stables against it without losing any Convex yield. With these borrowed stables, LP holders can reinvest in Curve gauge and further maximize your interest. Loops start. For details

With upcoming 4 pools, Lend Flare could help those who originally hold 3crv base and metapool LPs and further participating in 4 pool investment. Another loop.

Future Partnership Plan

Adopt Frax as Lend Flare supplied asset.  In other words, you can borrow Frax against corresponded Curve LP.

A FRAX DAO <> Lend Flare DAO swap of FXS<>LFT and permanently lock each other's tokens to align incentives.

For Lend Flare v2, we will create a synthetic assets LFUSD and pair with Frax in Curve which further create loop for our loan suppliers.

FPI (including the FPIS airdrop)

FRAXlend

FRAXswap

And this is something the team and us investors have been excited about for months.

In this thread i would like to put forward the idea of creating a budget that the team may use to help attract early investors and maybe even early users of the FRAXswap platform when it goes live.

I would like to propose we give the team permission to mint up to an additional 500,000 FXS (around $17.5m at today’s prices) to create a budget that could be used to help attract liquidity and users to FRAXswap in its first few months after launch.

If this budget gets voted in then the team will have permission to use the budget any way they choose as long as its being used to help FRAXswap gain liquidity and/or users.

Some examples of how the budget could be used are. addition FXS rewards for early LP stakers, tapering off over a few months. a random airdrop with a snapshot taken in the first few months and LP stakers getting rewarded. early users are added to the airdrop. the budget could be used to reward people that help promote the big 3. this budget could fund a twitter giveaway, “retweet this post and 5 people will win 100 FXS”. we could reward the first few protocols that trade on FRAXswap and post about it on twitter.

I would like to point out that if this does go to vote and it does pass then the team can still choose to veto it and there is nothing forcing them to carry out any action if they feel no action is needed.

My reasons for thinking a budget is needed is pretty simple. FRAXswap is built for large whales and protocols to use when they are doing large token swap. For them to be able to do this from day 1 we will need to have a good amount of liquidity. So we need to hit the ground running and be able to provide a service to the bigger investors from the start.

My second reason is, we are about to hand out a big chunk of $FPIS to investors (including other protocols) and i feel many investors are simply looking to sell and move on, but if we give them an attractive location to stake their $FPIS which maybe has another airdrop or increased rewards then its more likely that $FPIS holders will just stake their airdropped coins which in turn increases the liquidity for the few that still want to sell.

We only get one chance to launch FRAXswap and I want the team to have every tool they may need to make it a go as well as possible.

On behalf of Olympus DAO

Summary:

Add an OHM-FRAX gauge.

Background & Motivation:

OlympusDAO has a strong partnership with the Frax Finance protocol. Olympus has always focused around mutually beneficial protocol interactions, it’s in the (3,3) culture. To date Olympus has created deep liquidity with FRAX at a depth of 6M, aided in POL for Frax Finance through Olympus Pro (Total Bonded Value of 5M) and utilizes FRAX as Risk Free Value for the protocol (33M in reserves). This partnership continued with a DAO swap (OIP-53 Execute DAO Swap with Frax Finance 2) and the acceptance of Olympus being able to stake its FXS tokens (FIP-38 Whitelist OlympusDAO to Stake veFXS 3). Without hesitation Olympus locked for maximum duration, 4 years.

OlympusDAO would like to continue this close relationship through addition of the OHM-FRAX LP on Uniswap v3 as a gauge on the Frax Finance platform. Olympus wants to continue to gain its exposure to the Frax Finance ecosystem.

Benefits of this Gauge:

1.) OlympusDAO is a whitelisted protocol that can stake veFXS so it will bolster Olympus’ holdings FXS and will continue to lock FXS supply away.

2.) Continue to grow our already successful partnership as Frax Finance continue to innovate.

3.) In the future Olympus will be able to offer benefits to partners driving TVL to Frax Finance.

Summary

The Frax and Futureswap teams have been working together to enable a derivative layer on top of Frax products. This proposal will formalize the collaboration with a $3m token swap and the creation of a $8m long term AMM liquidity pool, which will include $4m of FRAX.

Background and Motivation

Frax is preparing for the next phase of expansion. FPI, Fraxswap and native lending markets are all on the horizon.

Futureswap ( https://www.futureswap.com/

5 ) is a decentralized non-custodial perpetual protocol where users can gain leveraged exposure on assets. Futureswap is live on Arbitrum and plans to expand to other chains in the coming weeks. More information about Futureswap can be found here 3.

Futureswap is working to provide a layer of derivative products on top of the Frax ecosystem. The Futureswap team is already assisting with Fraxswap and will be one of the first products to utilize Fraxswap once it is live. Some of the possible applications include leveraged exposure for pairs listed on Fraxswap, including leveraged exposure to inflation via FPI. Futureswap also plans on building products for Frax’s native lending markets.

There is tremendous potential for Futureswap and Frax to enable great markets together. The vision is for Futureswap to provide a derivative layer on top of Frax on all relevant chains. As we begin this effort, now is a great time to execute a token swap to align interests and benefit from mutual protocol growth going forward. The proposed swap amount is $3m of FXS for $3m of FST at a 30-day TWAP.

This proposal also authorizes the creation of an $8m long term FST/FRAX AMM pool, with Frax contributing $4m FRAX and Futureswap contributing $4m FST. This pool is designed to create a long term market for FST priced in FRAX with both protocols as equal owners of the LP positions.

This proposal is only for the approval of a $3m token swap and $4m FRAX for the AMM pool. The next phase of the collaboration will likely include Frax providing liquidity on Futureswap. This will be addressed in a future proposal.

Proposal

Authorize a $3m FXS swap for $3m FST at a 30-day TWAP and up to $4m FRAX for a long term FST/FRAX AMM pool to be jointly owned by both protocols.

Summary

Following FIP-44 that created the Hop AMO, the Frax and Hop teams have been working together to integrate FRAX on Hop. This proposal will authorize Frax comptrollers to deploy up to $50m of FRAX liquidity at their discretion once FRAX is live on Hop.

Background and Motivation

The previous proposal for the Hop AMO laid the groundwork for FRAX to be onboarded to Hop. Ideally this will occur in the coming weeks. In order to onboard FRAX, Frax will need to run a bonder to provide liquidity for FRAX transactions. This proposal will fund the bonder, which will be maintained by Frax comptrollers and earn fees for the Frax protocol. Frax can also seed liquidity in FRAX AMM pools on Hop. Frax will have access to all funds deployed and be able to increase or decrease funding at the discretion of the comptrollers. The end goal is to make FRAX the most attractive asset to use on L2 and the best option to bridge between L1<>L2 and L2<>L2.

With regards to the size of the proposal, the goal of the proposal is to give comptrollers the ability to provide enough liquidity to make FRAX a compelling option while also generating revenue for the protocol. The deployment of liquidity is at the discretion of the comptrollers. I expect that it will be scaled into over time.

FIP 48 - Dynamic Buyback/Recollateralize Functions,FIP 48 - Dynamic Buyback/Recollateralize Functions,"Mar 8, 2022 · 1:54 AM","Mar 8, 2022 · 6:00 AM","Mar 13, 2022 · 6:00 AM","Discussion therad: https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-48-dynamic-buyback-recollateralize-functions/773

Summary

Make the buyback & recollateralize functions 2 dynamically toggle when peg is below/above 1.0033 & .9966

Background & Motivation:

The FRAX peg has been practically unshakable and I’d like to suggest some improvements for both performance of both protocol functionality as well as FXS value accrual. Right now, per FIP 6 rules 4, the CR is changed periodically if the peg has not changed. This has been the case for many many months. I can’t recall when the peg has shifted even by a single 1/3rd of a cent. This proposal is to modify the Frax buyback/recollateralize function rules so that they are only activated when the peg deviates by 1/3rd of a cent between 1.0033 and .9966. This is for a few reasons: the protocol is extremely stable at CRs in this range and the CR adjustments occur much less frequently per FIP 6 rules. Secondly, large recollateralize functions mint a very large amount of FXS into circulation dramatically increasing the emission rate of FXS when it does not directly aid in any stability performing function. For example, just this week, over 50,000 FXS has been minted from recollateralize functions which almost has tripled the emission rate of FXS this week. That is a 300% inflation rate increase. If it was aiding in the stability of the protocol due to even slight peg deviation, that would be extremely valuable but as can be seen from the oracle price, the FRAX peg is at 1.000.

Regardless, there might come a day(s) when the peg price is deviating by more than 33% of 1 cent. This range is minimal but if this deviation occurs, this is exactly when the protocol will turn on buyback/recollateralize dependent on the CR and the direction of the peg to perform its core stabilizing function and bring the CR to target to restore confidence in the peg. I think this is a completely conservative and non-controversial improvement to the protocol which helps FXS value accrual by not causing excessive mints of FXS while also making sure it is possible to recollateralize if needed.

Working with Tokemak has worked out really well so far and we have since agreed to add (up to) $100m in FRAX liquidity to their protocol and included the FXS stakers on Tokemk in the $FPIS airdrop.

I would like to propose that we reach out to TOKE again and offer another $1m token swap based on the same terms of the first swap.

If they agree to do an OTC token swap then we should use our TOKE to vote for our own FXS pool on their platform.

Change 1:

Snapshot proposals can only be submitted by team members or someone designated by the team.

Reasoning:

In order to seamlessly integrate with the Frax voting system, there needs to be a way to automatically discern if a proposal on snapshot is a legit proposal or not, as well as check if it is correctly written, links provided, proper choices provided, etc. (Ex. Convex creates a bot that watches for new Frax proposals. When a proposal is created, Convex creates a matching proposal for its users to vote on)

Change 2:

Increase minimum proposal vote period to 5 days.

Decrease minimum forum discussion period to 3 days.

Reasoning:

DAO or other groups need to have time to complete their own local voting process before submitting to the official Frax proposal, thus more time should be allowed. (Longer voting periods can also help with quorum and discussions)

Concerning the forum discussion period, Sam from the Frax team suggested keeping an 8 day proposal window by lowering the forum discussion. The total period to discuss and vote will remain the same.

Change 3:

Change all votes from “Single Choice Voting” to “Weighted Voting”.

Reasoning:

This allows users to spread their vote weight across multiple answers. For a single user this might not affect their choice but for DAOs and other groups this gives them the option to spread their vote to better reflect the result of their own user base.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0x2fe26fe037f1a226c39d082a2f7a15093f7724768f2c945a403d839eda5652ea

This proposal seeks to establish a partnership between Sifchain and Frax. If it passes, $2,000,000 FRAX will be used to provision liquidity on Sifchain. Deep Liquidity on Sifchain will establish a gateway into the Cosmos ecosystem for FRAX, make FRAX transferable over IBC, and eventually enable FRAX to be used as collateral in margin trading positions against any token bridged to by Sifchain’s omni-EVM bridge.

Context:

After discussing a potential partnership with Frax on the community forums and receiving support from active Frax community members ( https://gov.frax.finance/t/sifchain-frax-collaboration-for-deep-liquidity-in-cosmos/752 ), the Sifchain community has decided to bring this proposal to a formal vote. Please read the linked thread for more resources including bridge audits, tokenomics clarifications, and other concerns.

About Sifchain :

Sifchain is a Cosmos SDK built DEX. Our primary value proposition is that we enable capital efficient cross-chain trading through two features: omni-EVM and deep margin. Other interesting aspects of Sifchain include our use of slip-based swap fees, eventual order-book implementation, and having ROWAN as a base pair for all pools.

Omni-EVM: Sifchain aims to be the first Omni-Chain DEX, connecting to 20–25 blockchains for cross-chain integration. The targeted blockchains represent the overwhelming majority of all cryptocurrency trading volume - thus actively traded assets from all chains will be accessed through the Sifchain DEX. Omni-EVM will enable any ERC20 token, any Cosmos Token, and any token that exists on ANY EVM compatible blockchain to be imported and traded in Sifchain.

Deep Margin: Hopefully coming as soon as Q2, Sifchain will deploy its novel architecture for margin trading - allowing traders to use leverage on their trades by borrowing from the liquidity pool. The interest rate is set based on market demand and liquidity supply. Liquidity providers are able to add liquidity into Sifchain’s pools symmetrically or asymmetrically, while MEV front-running in order placements is prevented through a commitment-reveal scheme.

Deep Margin + Omni-EVM: Any ERC20 token or Cosmos Network token will be able to be used as collateral in any margin trading position. Likewise, any such token can be longed or shorted. This unlocks nearly unlimited margin trading pairs and enables users to utilize this feature on tokens that have previously never been possible.

Technical Details:

Following the standards outlined in [ https://docs.frax.finance/cross-chain/bridge ], FRAX on Sifchain will not be the canonical representation of FRAX, and as such it will be called sifFRAX when traveling over IBC (Cosmos’s Inter-blockchain Communication Protocol).

Proposal Results:

For: establish a partnership with Sifchain and provision $2,000,000 (2 Million Dollars) of FRAX liquidity on Sifchain.

Against: do nothing

Execution :

Our market maker will work with the relevant members of the FRAX community to provision the initial liquidity for the pool. If a canonical version of FRAX is deployed at any time, Sifchain will work with the FRAX team to ensure that token fungibility between bridged assets and canonical assets is achieved to the satisfaction of both parties.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0x8fa0a222b770c05addc460f617514b007d932f9de0f2222d4425c92a2ee9ee30

Add a veFXS gauge for FRAX-VST Arbitrum Curve pool.

Background & Motivation:

Vesta Finance is a general purpose lending-stablecoin system based loosely on Liquity’s trove model. Vesta Finance is launching their native VST stablecoin and protocol on Arbitrum imminently. Liquity’s model has been very successful but due to Liquity’s lack of governance and inability to update any kind of parameters, they cannot do anything. Vesta fills this gap as a much more general purpose and exciting lending system. They have expressed interest in also expanding their lending model to include FXS and other FRAX friendly tokens.

We’d like to propose to help incentivize and create deep liquidity for VST-FRAX at launch so the projects are aligned in every way. Vesta has also committed to doing VSTA incentives for this gauge so this would be a dual token FXS+VSTA rewards gauge. This gauge would also help our Arbitrum expansion, so I think it is a net positive in multiple areas.

Activate cross-chain AMO and deploy Frax liquidity to dForce Lending (both on Ethereum and on Arbitrum), unlocking an alt¬¬¬ernative venue for Frax AMO to earn passive yields on Frax and USDC reserves.

Background dForce is building a comprehensive set of DeFi protocols covering assets, lending, trading, serving as layer 0 infrastructure in Web 3. dForce is currently deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and BSC with a TVL of over $400m. It is currently one of the largest lending protocols on Arbitrum and BSC in terms of TVL. dForce Lending has undergone extensive code reviews and security audits by Trail of Bits, ConsenSys Diligence, CertiK, Certora (formal verification), with a bug bounty launched through Immunefi. dForce lending protocol has withstood a number of market downturn and is battle-tested with more than one year of operation on-chain.

Forum discussion: https://gov.frax.finance/t/partnership-with-dforce-to-accelerate-multi-chain-expansion/368

Abstract

This proposal aims to expand Frax’s multi-chain liquidity and community through a partnership with dForce. We believe this integration demonstrates strong synergies between the two communities, and can help to further expand the utilization of Frax on different layers and chains.

As a blockchain agnostic protocol aiming to provide underlying DeFi infrastructure powering the development of Web 3, dForce pertains to the ability to interact with differing protocols in various environment, giving users the freedom of choice to change between blockchains.

Frax has proved its success with impressive growth since its launch, but in order to fulfil its vision as a decentralized currency, we believe it’s crucial for Frax to build influence far and wide in the lending market, one of the largest vehicles inside the DeFi space.

As a start, dForce announced lending support to Frax on Ethereum and Arbitrum, allowing users to borrow Frax against its supported assets.

We hope to build a solid partnership with Frax community to accelerate the multi-chain expansion for both in a way that benefit both communities meaningfully.

Motivation •   Revenue: unlocking an alternative venue for Frax AMO to earn passive yields on Frax and possibly USDC reserves. •   Exposure: dForce is one of the largest lending protocols in terms of TVL on Arbitrum and BSC. We believe dForce’s support can help Frax to consolidate and strengthen its foothold as a leading decentralized currency. •   Expansion: dForce is currently deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, BSC, and can facilitate faster expansion of Frax to multiple chains and layers.

Proposal

It is proposed to deploy AMO with Frax liquidity (Ethereum and Arbitrum) to dForce Lending, further enhancing Frax’s ability to interact with other DeFi applications and assets in a meaningful way (i.e., supply wstETH or UNI or to borrow Frax).

Grant for a team of 2 devs to do the following:

Build a detailed analytics dashboard for Frax that tracks protocol owned assets, earnings, usage metrics, and others, across all chains Frax is deployed

Gather information and propose improvements to how the protocol allocates its treasury in order to increase profit and maximize Frax use cases

Propose new gauge pools and improvements to its allocation in order to maximize growth of Frax usage

Build an information site to display the partnerships Frax has made, how much has been spent on each, DAO-swapped FXS in case it happened and how they are using their FXS, etc.

Have a more active conversation on Governance Discussion with protocols that seek partnerships with Frax and provide reports on benefits and risks

Seek new partnerships and recommend possible investments in protocols that would help Frax expansion and use cases

Proposal

Analytics dashboard

Treasury and protocol owned value management are fundamental for a DAO to work. First step of how to properly do this is to have an accurate account of it, currently Frax has two sources of this: the Dune dashboard 2 and the AMOs dashboard. The Dune dashboard has several problems, it is not useful for multi-chain information, has little interactivity, and available graphs are limited, in its favor we can say that is displays information over time. The AMOs dashboard improves in multi-chain information, but does not provide a good understanding of the data over time. Besides, there is a lot of additional information that should be measured, such as how much of the circulating Frax is owned by the protocol, what are the assets and liquidity deployed on DEXes, what are the volumes on those pools, how much the deployed funds are making and have made over time, what is the Frax volume, how much of the Frax is locked in bridges, and more.

For these reasons, and others, such as an absolute transparency and ease of understanding, we think that more efforts on tracking the protocol holdings should be made and we request for a grant to build an in-depth dashboard for this, along with additional information such as Frax usage.

Suggestions for treasury allocation

Currently the protocol has liquidity and assets supplied across several markets, although it is questionable how each particular pool contributes to the protocol. What we would like to seek is to maximize the profits and use cases each deployment provides for Frax, but in a lot of cases it is really negligible. For example, if we look at the Uniswap V3 pools:

Captura de Pantalla 2022-01-31 a la(s) 15.10.06

Captura de Pantalla 2022-01-31 a la(s) 15.10.06

2360×1140 188 KB

Of these pools, the protocol controls the 9m in the USDT pool, the 5m in the LUSD pool, the 4.75m in the sUSD pool, the 2.34m in the RAI pool and the 1.5m in the UST pool. As we can see the volume on these pools is very low, which makes us wonder if and how could we make a better use of these funds.

One of the tasks of this grant will be to analyze and seek to improve how treasury funds are allocated.

Propose new pool gauges and emissions

As we also see in the above picture of Uni V3 pools, around 260m are deposited in the USDC and DAI pools, but they present very low volume, as a comparison, the 1bps DAI/USDC has 234m TVL with 330m 7-day volume, and the 1bps USDC/USDT has 186m TVL and 1b 7-day volume. Although it may not be a completely on par comparison, the objective of FXS should be to compensate for users that are taking a risk (like the FXS/FRAX pool) or provide a usage of Frax (like the StakeDAO ETH-Put Strategy). Neither is the case for the deposits on the FRAX/USDC and DAI/FRAX pools, based on the low volume of those pools, and the fact that the current risk of Frax loosing it’s peg its 0.

For this reason, we think that seeking for ways to improve the gauge FXS emissions in order to increase the Frax usage is very important, and will be one of the objectives of this grant.

DAO Partneship Information

Frax has invested in several protocols, such as TempleDAO, OlympusDAO, OndoFinance, and performed treasury swaps with some others like LOBIS or Tokemak. We propose to build and interface to show the status of this partnerships, such as how much the protocol has invested, how it is being used, and how the other protocols are using their FXS if they have.

5 and 6. Frax partnerships

Several protocols have reached out to Frax in order to propose partnerships, but we have seen in some cases that they have received little attention, such as the IdleDAO team. We aim to build better conversations with some of the protocols and provide reports of possible benefits and risks for the Frax community in order to keep them informed, not just taking someone words for it, and make better decissions. Also, we propose keep an eye out for possible new partnerships or investments that could be beneficial for Frax. (Important to note that to make a good work in this, time is of essence, for this reason, the amount of protocols to be reviewed are limited at 3 or 4 per month, left at the devs discretion)

Planning

We think this is a very ambitious proposal, for this reason reason we request funds for 2 devs, Seba will be the main face behind the proposal and has a pre-agreement with an additional dev. This proposal is intended to provide funds for at least two months. Work on the Frax Analytics Dashboard will begin immediately and we expect to have a public, possibly incomplete, version in February. Points 2,3,5 and 6 will also begin immediately and concurrently. Point 4 will be less of a priority and work on it will be based on devs criterion, time availability and, in case of a high Frax community demand, may be prioritized.

Compensation

Based on the size of this proposal and how much it can contribute to Frax, we think that a grant of $4k in Frax and $4k in FXS, the latter vested for 6 months as standard, per dev per month, is a fair compensation (although we understand possible concerns about this and are open to a negotiation). Also, based on my current experience with the Dune dashboard, I think it would be fair to value each FXS at the minimum between the 14-day and 30-day average at the time of payment, due to high price variance. Finally, payment will be done in three steps, an initial payment of $4k Frax at the beginning of the work for each dev, after the first month $4k Frax + $4k in FXS, and after the 2 months the remaining $4k in FXS for each dev. After the 2 months, the continuation of the grant and agreement will be open to renegotiation.

I hope you guys can also agree that this is an important work for Frax, beginning to work on our data can be very helpfup (as MakerDAO is 2), and please share any questions, concerns, additions, etc. you have about this proposal.

Proposed by.

Summary

Create a Hop AMO to provide liquidity directly to the Hop protocol.

Background and Motivation

Hop ( https://hop.exchange/ ) is a scalable rollup-to-rollup general token bridge built on Ethereum. Hop lets users to send tokens from one rollup to another almost immediately without having to wait for the rollup’s challenge period.

Ethereum’s Layer 2 (L2 - rollups that utilize the Ethereum main chain for security) will likely become synonymous with “Ethereum” in the not distant future. Currently the most feature rich rollups are Optimistic rollups, which have a seven day withdraw period for assets exiting L2. Hop offers near instant withdrawals for users exiting L2, which will be critical for the widespread adoption of L2 on Ethereum. Hop also offers the best trust assumptions of existing bridges.

As we plan the next phase of growth for Frax, FRAX should become one of the most liquid assets on L2. I propose that Frax create a Hop AMO to provide liquidity directly to Hop to help achieve this goal. Deployed liquidity will earn a yield on Hop, creating a win / win situation for Frax and Hop. If the vision of Hop is achieved, it will become a quasi public good that serves as the connective tissue between L1<>L2 and L2<>L2. Frax can help Hop realize this vision and onboard more users to L2, which also helps Ethereum scale.

Phases

In the near term, Frax can provide stablecoin liquidity (likely USDC / DAI in the short term) for both Hop AMMs and bonding (bonded capital enables fast withdrawals on Hop). We can authorize up to $20m of liquidity in this proposal which we can scale up to over time. If all goes well, I anticipate expanding the AMO significantly in a subsequent snapshot based on Hop demand. In this phase, any bonding will be done in cooperation with the Hop team and the optimal structure and sizing will be determined collaboratively. This is an opportunity for Frax to support Hop and Ethereum scaling by providing liquidity while also earning a return on protocol owned assets.

The first phase is the extent of this proposal. If all goes well with the AMO and the community is on-board with further collaboration, the next obvious step is to work to add Frax to Hop and supply FRAX (and perhaps FPI) liquidity to Hop. The AMO can deploy large amounts of Frax to make it the most liquid and cost-efficient asset to bridge Ethereum L1<>L2 and L2<>L2.

Proposal

Create a Hop AMO and authorize up to $20m of liquidity for use in the AMO.

There has been times when FRAX has seen an opportunity to make a quick investment and has not been able to react due to the time needed to take a vote. Because we have a vote it gives other investors the time to front run us and we end up paying a higher price.

So i would like to propose the following.

We allocate up to $25m FRAX to a war chest fund for the FRAX team to use as they please to buy assets or pay for services that will benefit the FRAX protocol.

The War chest will have its own allocated wallet so spending and remaining balance can be followed.

The vote will be as follows.

1, allocate $25m

2, allocate $10m

3, do nothing

We just voted to buy another $2m of TEMPLE to add to our current TEMPLE position and I feel this may indicate that we (The people of FRAX) are looking to add to our current Protocol assets, so i would like to propose the following as a 3 month trial.

We allocate $2m per month to add to our current protocol assets with the following rules.

1, we vote once each month on what to buy.

2, we only list assets that the FRAX protocol already holds in the vote.

3, when an asset wins a vote they are not included in vote for the following month.

4, The option to “do nothing” must be included in each vote.

5, The option to let the FRAX committee choose what to buy must be included in every vote. ** if the FRAX committee wins the vote the committee can spend the $2m on ANY coin / token that they feel will be good for FRAX (even if we dont currently hold it)

The vote will be put up on the 1st of each month (starting in march) and voting will last 5 days. Once voting is complete the team have the rest of the month to complete the purchase

I see this as a good way to add to our holdings, increase the power of FXS and veFXS voting and give smaller FXS holders a chance to be included (as voting is free). It also gives more value to having a FRAX partnership or DAO-DAO swap as it would then mean the other protocol will be added to the monthly asset Acquisition vote.

The more value FXS controls the more value the FXS is worth ,  right now it controls the FRAX emissions, with this in place it could also control a small amount of the protocol's operating profits too.

RenaissanceDAO partners with FRAX to bridge FRAX liquidity to Aurora.

SUMMARY

RenaissanceDAO will create an ART-FRAX pool and allow bonding with FRAX to users. Once enough liquidity has built up in the ART-FRAX pool, we want to extend this partnership through AMOs. FRAX expansions are sent to this AMO to purchase and stake $ART. The AMO will increase FRAX’s balance sheet and improve ART-FRAX liquidity. RenaissanceDAO benefits from accumulating stable coins in the early stages and presents a creative investment opportunity for FRAX to provide liquidity in the NFT market. The purpose of the Renaissance <> FRAX partnership is to grow algorithmic stablecoins into Defi and NFT markets together.

WHY FRAX <> RENAISSANCE?

The RenaissanceDAO is an upcoming community-driven project designed to drive innovation in NFT ownership by utilizing the time-tested foundation of OHM’s reserve currency on Aurora . To date, we are a community of twenty eight-thousands, who rally behind the convergence of art, blockchain technology, and autonomy via decentralization.

Our vision is to create and own the largest decentralized NFT liquidity pools, using DeFi primitives, that facilitate trading of fractionalized NFTs. We believe that this approach lowers existing barriers-to-entry for numerous market participants who are currently unable to interact with “blue-chip” NFTs, which continue to highlight the strong negative correlation between risk and price in the NFT ecosystem. In this sense, fractionalization allows buyers to allocate their funds to safer assets—positions that can be entered and exited with ease via designated liquidity pools.

Renaissance’s token, $ART, is built to accelerate and aggregate investment into the digital art space. Proceeds from issuances of $ART tokens are funneled into purchasing NFT collections, decided by the community of tokenholders. Overtime, as the Treasury begins to amass a collection of NFTs, the expectation is for the $ART token to act as an index token of all the underlying digital art assets.

TECHNICAL DETAILS

DAO governed NFT purchases - 20% of bond profits are allocated to the NFT treasury. These funds will be used for NFT purchases that are directed by active community voting at each epoch. The ability to participate in governance will be obtained through staking, and all votes will be obscured through zero knowledge proof until the NFT purchase has completed.

Fractionalized NFT liquidity pool / decentralized NFT exchange - Purchased NFTs from the treasury will be fractionalized and listed for internal IDOs (stakers only) to establish liquidity pools, which can be utilized by any user to freely trade the fractionalized shares through our NFT-Automated Market Maker (AMM).

Renaissance DAO has chosen and will continue to use FRAX as the predominant and first stablecoin to be used in the treasury. We fully support the innovation, vision, and community of FRAX.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0xda0ca1be9599fdab07404db1e035058b2de65b92bde50a5b2f31622945db0273

Since then a lot has changed and we generally ignore the rules set out in the first version of the governance process and i propose we update them so they fit the current way that FRAX operates.

Here is the new governance process I would like to put forward.

No discussion or vote is needed for :

1, non-controversial parameter adjustments by Frax developers

2, non-controversial usage of voting power in 3rd party protocols by Frax developers

All other proposals must be posted to the governance forum and have a discussion period prior to having a formal vote.

1, 5 day minimum discussion period for all proposals

2, 10 day minimum discussion period for meta-governance or FXS emission related proposals.

Meta-governance proposals are proposals that change the governance process of the Frax protocol or impact how the protocol is governed. Emission related proposals alter FXS emissions. Unless they seek to establish recurring FXS incentives, proposals for the DAO to spend FXS from the treasury are not emission related.

Formal voting.

1, Votes must be open for a minimum of 3 days.

2, Votes for meta-governance or FXS emissions must be open for a minimum of 5 days.

3, A simple majority wins the vote.

4, A link to the discussion thread must be included when posting a vote. *To be added at a later date if we get spam problem

1000 FXS (or veFXS) is the minimum amount needed to post a vote.

Quorum.

1, A quorum of 800,000 votes is required for the result to be valid

2, For meta-governance or FXS emission related votes, a quorum of 2,000,00 votes is required for the result to be valid.

Allocate up to $10m worth of FXS to Votium for the bi-weekly Convex Gauge-Weight Vote,Allocate up to $10m worth of FXS to Votium for the bi-weekly Convex Gauge-Weight Vote,"Jan 22, 2022 · 12:43 PM","Jan 22, 2022 · 4:00 AM","Jan 24, 2022 · 4:00 AM","Authors

Summary:

The previous December 9th Convex Votium bribe snapshot continuously allocated up to $5m worth of FXS per week for the bi-weekly Convex Gauge-Weight Vote to bribe for the FRAX3CRV gauge on Votium. As the gauges have become more competitive recently, with an expected increase in bribe amounts from other protocols, we are proposing to increase the bribe up to $10m worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Note that this is simply the maximum amount, and not necessarily the exact amount that will be bribed on Votium.

Background & Motivation:

The Curve pool gauge-weight vote is voted on by veCRV holders, of which Convex holds roughly half the circulating supply. Convex allows holders of vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) to vote on how the platform's veCRV should be allocated.

Votium allows for anyone to create a bribe for vlCVX holders for a specific gauge, claimable upon voting in Convex's bi-weekly snapshot allocation.

Frax currently has 35.5% of Convex's entire veCRV amount in the Curve gauge-weight vote, up from 28.8% three periods ago. Convex's veCRV gauge allocation is re-weighted every other week, with the current vote ending on January 24th. To defend our allocation, we propose increasing the bribes to up to $10m worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Rewards from increased gauge APR will be distributed across all FXS holders due to FXS1559 buying back FXS with protocol profit.

As this has been on onging allocation, the change would carry forward to future Convex gauge weight voting periods.

Lobis kept locking its FXS on a weekly basis

Lobis votes for the Frax reactor on Tokemak with 100% of its TOKE holdings (top 10 holder)

Lobis market bought c.$10m worth of FXS

LOBI is trading below its backing value, and backing is made of FXS, TOKE, CRV, SDT, ANGLE and OHM, only high quality asset that should give comfort on the limited risk of this token swap (treasury composition here: https://app.lobis.finance/#/dashboard )

Summary:

Swap $1m worth of FXS from community multisig at a 7 day TWAP price for $1m worth of LOBI at 7 day TWAP price.

Background & Motivation:

Lobis is a huge supporter of Frax and has been market buying FXS since it went live.

We started locking our FXS and built an infrastructure enabling the Lobis community to take part in Frax’s governance and start building bridges betweet the two community.

To strengthen our partnership and build it for the long term, we believe that it is important that Frax also has its say in Lobis’ governance.

Therefore, we suggest doing a $1m token swap between LOBI and FXS.

FXS owned by Lobis will be either directly locked or go through a locker (or any other way it could be useful to Frax).

With the LOBI it owns, Frax will be able to vote on Tokemak’s gauge for liquidity direction, and eventually on Curve gauges. It will also be able to vote on Lobis’ governance, including for policy matters such as the rate of acquisition of FXS. Finally, it will also have a word at how Lobis votes on Frax governance, which is healthy.

This vote is only for the DAO to DAO swap but would be a good first step for a broader partnership between the two protocols.

Choices:

1 - Do a $1m token swap LOBI/FXS

2 - Do up to 5 $200k token swaps (maximum one every other week)

Themis is the first-ever protocol that provides borrowing & lending for the AMMs market starting with Uni V3 positions. For more information please check out; Website 9, Twitter 1, Docs 1

TL;DR;

Themis allows users who have a liquidity position with Uniswap v3 to collateralize up to 65% of their LP assets.

This means that if you have $10k in LP assets, you could receive up to $6500 in stablecoins like FRAX to do with as you will. Buy Lambo, go long on Shiba Inu, reinvest right back into your LP, who cares?

A good example would be the FRAX/USDC LP pair, users are able to collateralize their LP and borrow up to 65% in supported stables coins like FRAX and other whitelisted assets, which makes the current FRAX/USDC pair at least 165% more capital efficient.

The success factor of any stablecoin derives from 3 things; community, liquidity, and adoption. The Frax community is no doubt one of the most forward thinking communities out there. You guys are building what will become the future of modern central banking. Themis wants to partner with you guys and allow you to increase your liquidity and adoption.

Potential roadblocks/risks for the Frax community;

Smart contract risks of being exploited. – Our smart contract and business logic have been audited by a reputable 3rd party. Also, we will soon be launching a bounty program with Immunefi.

Borrowers default; risk of default. – We will be whitelisting selected V3 LP pairs that fit our risk model of liquidity, reputation, and volatility to ensure the safety of our lenders. Our liquidation kicks in at 80% ensuring that our borrowers are always over collateralized at any given time. There is minimal risk of being liquidated however, a full or partial repayment back to the loan contract can be made at any time to lower this percentage.

Themis is a new protocol that is currently bootstrapping its lending liquidity. And, it’s a great way for the AMO to earn organic interest but also Themis’ governance tokens without risk of impermanent loss or volatility.

With that said, we’re applying for $10m to kickstart the protocol. All funds will be locked via smart contract for 9 months.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0x755127e5739706be013416847525fa26bb64210357dffd8e12ca2ff18414f01a

QiDao Protocol : add FXS as collateral for MAI, start a FRAX-MAI stable LP on Polygon, and add MAI as collateral for FRAX.

Original governance forum link: https://gov.frax.finance/t/partner-with-qidao-protocol/596

Background

QiDao is a collateral debt position (CDP) stablecoin protocol behind MAI. MAI is backed by a basket of assets, ranging from stable assets to volatile assets. The following tokens hold the largest shares of collateral for MAI: WETH (23%), MATIC (19%), and WBTC (15%). There is no USDC backing MAI at the time of writing.

MAI can currently be minted on 5 chains and can be bridged to 12 chains, with a TVL of $150M.

Partnership details:

QiDao adds FXS as collateral for MAI. This will allow users to mint MAI stablecoins at 0% interest against their FXS (while maintaining ownership of their FXS). Approving FXS as collateral on Polygon will approve it as collateral on all chains where MAI can be minted. That is currently Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Moonriver, and Harmony.

Frax mints 2M MAI at a safe LTV ratio (50%)

Frax creates an LP with the minted MAI and FRAX

QiDao will secure incentives from the DEX that LP is deployed on to maximize volume and TVL

Add MAI as a collateral asset for minting/redeeming FRAX natively on Polygon

Motivation:

FXS holders will be able to use FXS without spending it. There’s no interest cost for minting MAI against collateral.

FXS vaults will be eligible for MAI borrowing rewards. These rewards are decided on twice a month through a gauge voting system.

As QiDao continues to expand to other chains, FXS will be already whitelisted as collateral on new chains.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0x35eaeb204b8c740908a5d9f76a8fae6a4db97e52db0584d2df6f1c293576fb65

Stake 4.5m FXS from the protocol treasury into veFXS to provide yield for protocol treasury.

Introduction

5% of the genesis FXS supply is in the hands of the Core Team Treasury to be deployed for the sole purpose of growing the Frax Protocol to become one of the most important cryptocurrency projects in the world.

In order to achieve that mission, we propose staking 4.5m FXS in veFXS for 6 months to attain yield and allocating that yield. We will use the veFXS yield to fund expansion of the team, bringing onboard community moderators/business developers/outreach, new developers, and create the Frax Grants+Incubator Program. The remaining 500k FXS not staked will be used for similar initiatives. This allows the treasury to fund these programs regardless if veFXS yield crashes or if there is a protracted bear market, allowing the Frax Protocol to continue its mission of becoming one of the most important protocols no matter what.

After 6 months, this exact proposal (with any modifications/adjustments) will go live for another community vote before further allocation of funds so that the project team & extended contributors are held accountable to FXS tokenholders.

The core team will NOT VOTE using the staked veFXS or treasury address so this proposal will NOT affect the team’s ability to sway governance in any way.

Background

The Frax Team Treasury is composed of 5m FXS. This treasury has largely been dormant for the first year of the Frax Protocol. Now that almost all FXS tokens have been released other than the community allocation through gauge emissions, we propose kickstarting the allocation of this treasury in a strategic manner to exponentially grow the pace of FRAX development & further decentralize the work, collaboration, and involvement of the extended community.

Summary

PrometheusDAO is an Olympus inspired reserve currency project on Polygon with unique features (NFTs and P2E MMORPG) to be integrated with the protocol. PrometheusDAO would like to use FRAX-PRM bonds to grow protocol controlled liquidity in Frax.

Why Frax?

There is no shortage of reasons why Frax is the top choice, with Frax offering more than just a stable coin.

Frax will enable us to provide lending and borrowing features directly to PrometheusDAO (just as MIM is to TIME, Frax will allow us to do the same). Frax is very familiar with the space, already having a pair with OlympusDAO and many others, and now joining forces with PrometheusDAO to provide Frax development on Polygon. Frax embodies the community and collaborative spirit in ways few other projects do. This is the type of culture we at PrometheusDAO strive to become as well. Having had conversations with Sam Kazemian directly, he was incredibly welcoming of the prospect of partnership and collaboration, despite us being a project in our early stages. As a result, we have deepened our respect for Sam’s commitment to furthering the space, being a mentor and a long-term partner. We are truly excited to cultivate a beneficial relationship based on trust, innovation and an unwavering dedication to our respective long-term goals.

Use AMO to allocate $FRAX to Tokemak base pair reactor?,Use AMO to allocate $FRAX to Tokemak base pair reactor?,"Dec 31, 2021 · 11:42 PM","Jan 1, 2022 · 4:00 AM","Jan 6, 2022 · 4:00 AM","As originally suggested in the Governance discussion forum ( https://gov.frax.finance/t/using-amo-to-fill-tokemak-frax-pair-reactor/515 ), Frax can drive additional $FRAX liquidity by allocating to the newly created $FRAX reactor on Tokemak.

The outline is below highlighting the logic behind the reasons for doing so:

Fraximalists should be familiar with Tokemak as $FXS was one of the first reactors. The team at Tokemak has built something that may solve a major problem for any protocol trying to deepen liquidity; not only can they alleviate the burden of protocols trying to manage their own liquidity, they can help cut farming emissions by a significant amount; see Alchemix example here: https://medium.com/tokemak/the-evolution-of-daos-1692509bbb41

Tokemak recently launched base pair reactors, which are stable coin reactors where those assets can be paired with the other token reactors to create LP pairs (i.e. FRAX + OHM). FRAX, FEI, DAI, UST, and LUSD were added to ETH and USDC base pair reactors.

From the announcement: ""Tokemak is a kingmaker for stablecoins: the Pair asset with the most TOKE staked to it will naturally attract the most TVL for that stablecoin, thereby appointing that asset the one with the most pairings and liquidity across DeFi.""

By being the first stablecoin to load a reactor, Frax could drive the TOKE side of the reactor’s APR up significantly, which would drive the APR higher in order to seek balance, and when TOKE is voted, those folks become Liquidity Directors and have a say in how $FRAX is deployed.

Phantom DAO is an Olympus inspired treasury-backed accelerator project exclusively on Fantom with unique features built into the protocol. Phantom DAO would like to use FRAX-PHM bonds to predominantly grow protocol controlled liquidity in FRAX.

Additionally, FRAX should invest in Phantom DAO’s native PHM token either through a Phantom AMO or a treasury swap with AMO profits from the protocol (at community discretion).

Lastly, FRAX should provide lending liquidity through our SCREAM AMO or an exclusive lending system as the FRAX-PHM liquidity will be quite deep thanks to bond purchases.

Background

Phantom DAO is a treasury-backed accelerator project similar to Olympus DAO but with unique treasury yield farming mechanics and the accelerator within the DAO. Phantom DAO is currently on the eponymous Fantom network. Phantom DAO also is an official partner of Olympus DAO which means FRAX-PHM-OHM can team up in the future as well.

FRAX has native minting and AMO capability on Fantom and has expanded its ecosystem in lending and liquidity through SCREAM+SpiritSwap.

Proposal

Seba is a member of the Frax commnunity who build the Dune dashboard https://dune.xyz/seba/Frax . This a proposal to provide a compensation of 850 FXS ($12.000 with FXS at $14, at time of initial discussion) for the work done.

Community members also suggested to include an upkeep cost of $1.000 for the maintenance of the dashboard. The maintenance would consist of keeping up to date the information of the current plots, for example recent information to count cvxFXS holders was included. In case this maintenance cost is accepted it would begin to apply on the month of February.

All future modifications and improvements of the Dune dashboard that would require a considerable amount of time and effort will have to apply for a grant prior to the work being finished.

The proposal was first discussed in the governance forum https://gov.frax.finance/t/compensate-work-done-on-the-dune-dashboard/497

Now its time to address the issue of making this more decentralized. To do this i would like to propose the following.

Right now we have a group of people controlling the governance power FRAX holds , lets call this group the “FRAX committee”. Right now all the roles in the FRAX committee are held by team members, as we just voted for them to have the voting power.

I propose we have a round of voting to add 1 person to the FRAX committee thats not a team member, we can make a thread for interested investors to express their interest in taking on the role and make their case for being voted in to the FRAX committee. Once some time has passed we could then list all the interested parties in a vote and the FXS holders can vote in the person they wish to be added to the committee.

Every 3 months we can repeat the process and vote in another member until we reach the ideal number of people to run the FRAX committee.

Once we reach the ideal number we could carry on voting people in but as new people join a FRAX team member steps down from the role (the FRAX team can choose who steps down).

We then carry on voting people in until there is 1 FRAX team member left and the FRAX committee is made up of 1 team member and the people voted in.

To do this we would need to agree on the ideal number of people to have on the committee, personally i think 7 people is ideal to start with, but we may need to increase this as we gain more voting power in a wider selection of protocols. This number can be increased at a later date if needed but i feel 7 is a good starting place.

We should agree on some basic’s for all people applying for the positions. must be able to communicate in good English must be an active FRAX community member must have a good understanding of FRAX’s long term goals must be able to work well in a group

As before, any time the FRAX committee votes on a proposal it should be posted to the community and should be in the interest of FRAX.

If this part of the governance proposal is voted in i foresee it taking 18-24 months to play out as we have a vote every few months. The reason for this sort of time frame is stability , having a slow and steady hand over of power is much better then just changing everything in a few weeks.

Summary:

Increase minting of up to $65m FRAX+FXS per chain for AMOs on the following networks: Polygon, Arbitrum, Moonriver+Moonbeam, Fantom, BSC, Solana, Harmony, Optimism, Boba Network, and Avalanche. Previous designated amount was $20m.

Background & Motivation:

FRAX has aggressively set up the infrastructure and bridging required to expand to Polygon, Moonriver+Moonbeam, Fantom, BSC, Solana, Optimism, Harmony, Boba Network, and Avalanche. With initial liquidity deployment successful, Comptrollers are ready to continue lending and liquidity market operation activities to further deep borrowing markets and trading depth on each of the above networks.

Comptrollers will continue to pick the most promising and reputable lending market and AMM per chain to conduct algorithmic market operations on, with a limit of up to $65m per chain. For minted FRAX on such chains, the Collateral Ratio (CR) will adjust accordingly on ETH L1 and keep global count across all chains. All FRAX+FXS is entirely fungible and there is only 1 CR globally across all chains so that there is no excessive minting occurring that could affect FRAX peg performance on ETH or any other chain since arbitrage is kept open across all FRAX+FXS across every network.

Note that no minting will occur above 100m FXS supply and the cap will be observed.

This proposal seeks to establish a Frax and Ondo partnership. This partnership would build on Ondo’s Liquidity-as-a-Service offering and enable the use of $FRAX (provided by the protocol itself) as liquidity for token issuers.

We propose that a portion of the future expansion of the FRAX stablecoin be minted into Frax-as-a-Service vaults as needed. This means that Frax will have no upfront costs to participate.

About Frax-as-a-Service:

Frax-as-a-Service (“FaaS”) is an offering from Ondo to make it possible for projects issuing tokens to increase the liquidity in their native tokens on decentralized exchanges by providing liquidity themselves. With FaaS, a project can deposit its token into an Ondo liquidity vault with a flexible duration. Ondo and Frax will match those deposits with an equivalent amount of FRAX to form a liquidity pair. In exchange for providing FRAX, the Frax DAO will receive a fixed 5% APR return on its provided liquidity. We plan to leverage Frax’s success at building a multichain ecosystem and hope to deploy on several other chains starting with Polygon.

Ondo provides several advantages over existing liquidity solutions. With Ondo, token issuers earn trading fees and rewards which reduce (or even negate) impermanent loss (IL) risk and the cost of capital. With small adjustments, Ondo vaults are well-suited to facilitating direct listings, establishing the first liquidity for a token. Direct listings could eventually replace or complement IDOs. We would love to work directly with Frax to build out these future offerings.

Framework for Onboarding New FaaS Partners

We propose using the following framework for deciding whether to offer FaaS vaults to new token issuers:

High Market Cap Protocols: $1B FDV - Up to $25M of FRAX

Medium Market Cap Protocols: $250m FDV - Up to $10m of FRAX

Smaller Market Cap Protocols: Minimum $50M Circulating Supply - Up to $5M of FRAX

FXS Incentives:

We propose that Frax incentivize token issuers to use Frax-as-a-Service with FXS rewards. The new Uniswap and Sushiswap liquidity pools in FRAX the program would create do not yet have histories of income from trading fees that investors can rely on for returns forecasting. As such, incentives will help with onboarding new projects to FaaS with FRAX and will help bootstrap a sustainable model going forward, that will not rely on indefinite incentives.

Fei Protocol made a similar commitment of TRIBE incentives for its bootstrapping of LaaS. We recommend that Frax matches Fei’s commitment of providing what amounts today to roughly 500 FXS per week per $1M of liquidity from a participating DAO ($2M total including FRAX) added to FaaS. The amount of incentives provided would max out at 25,000 in FXS per week based on current prices (500 FXS per week per $1M in partner liquidity assuming $50M in total partner liquidity). If more than $50M in partner liquidity is provided ($100M in total liquidity), then the total FXS incentives from the program would be shared pro-rata with partners based on their contribution. For example, if participating projects and their communities provided $100M of liquidity, then incentives would be diluted down to 250 per week per $1M of liquidity. We strongly believe that this initial expense will be well worth it to attract new partners and foster the growth of the FRAX stablecoin.

Benefits to Frax:

A 5% Fixed APR on all FRAX used as FaaS liquidity

Build out new and strengthen existing relationships with other   communities

Increase the supply of FRAX and expand its reach

Establish new liquidity pools based in FRAX with a focus on multichain initiatives

Risks to Frax:

The fixed tranche side of our vaults (which FRAX would be deposited into) can realize losses if the variable tranche side of the pair experiences about an 80% decline in price.

Smart contract risk with Ondo. We have three audits available for review here. One of our audits is from Quantstamp.

Please Vote Below For One of Following Two Options:

Establish a partnership with Ondo and allow the Frax core team to pick FaaS partners

Summary:

The previous

November 11th Convex Votium bribe snapshot continuously allocated up to $2.5m worth of FXS for the bi-weekly Convex Gauge-Weight Vote to bribe for the FRAX3CRV gauge on votium. As the gauges have become more competitive recently, with an expected increase in bribe amounts from other protocols, we are proposing to increase the bribe up to $5m worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Note that this is simply the maximum amount, and not necessarily the exact amount that will be bribed on Votium.

Background & Motivation:

The Curve pool gauge-weight vote is voted on by veCRV holders, of which Convex holds roughly half the circulating supply. Convex allows holders of vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) to vote on how the platform's veCRV should be allocated.

Votium allows for anyone to create a bribe for vlCVX holders for a specific gauge, claimable upon voting in Convex's bi-weekly snapshot allocation.

Frax currently has 28.8% of Convex's entire veCRV amount in the Curve gauge-weight vote, up from 15.1% two periods ago. Convex's veCRV gauge allocation is re-weighted every other week, with the current vote ending on November 15th. To defend our allocation, we propose increasing the bribes to up to $5m worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Rewards from increased gauge APR will be distributed across all FXS holders due to FXS1559 buying back FXS with protocol profit.

As this has been on onging allocation, the change would carry forward to future Convex gauge weight voting periods.

Abstract: vaFRAX is the tokenized pool share of Vesper's recently launched FRAX pool, which deploys FRAX deposits across miscellaneous strategies to compound yield on platforms like Aave, Rari Fuse, Curve, and Convex.

There are several key benefits to the FRAX ecosystem through this proposal:

2.) Higher liquidity on protocols that are not as easily incentivized with gauges, such as Rari Fuse pools and Aave.

Frax & ZigZag partnership: Frax provides liquidity for the FRAX-USDC & FRAX-ETH pairs on ZigZag’s L2 DEX.

Summary

Allow Frax to provide liquidity to the Decentralized Exchange ‘‘ZigZag’’ on the L2s zkSync & StarkNet by minting FRAX and supplying ETH + USDC for collateral.

Introduction

ZigZag is a decentralized orderbook exchange powered by ZK Rollups. Currently, we are the only live DEX on zkSync 1.0. Besides that, we are launching on StarkNet next month as the first and only DEX and will launch on zkSync 2.0. We are aiming for deep liquidity with thick order books which we think could be mutually beneficial with Frax.

Governance Proposal

We propose for Frax to mint 5M FRAX and bridge over the minted FRAX to L2s zkSync 1.0 and StarkNet. Furthermore, we propose for Frax to provide $2.5M equivalent in ETH and $2.5M equivalent USDC collateral as liquidity to ZigZag. This way Frax provides liquidity for a total of $10M to zkSync 1.0 and ZigZag’s StarkNet launch. After StarkNet launch, more FRAX will be minted and more ETH and USDC collateral will be provided as liquidity ($10M) for a total amount of $20M.

As more attention is being given to ZK-Proofs, it becomes clear that this is the final method of scaling Ethereum and a lot of TVL from alternative L2s will flow into zkSync and StarkNet’s networks. For Frax to get a well-established position into this new ecosystem, our exchange introducing FRAX as a stablecoin pair would bring more use case/liquidity and utility to the whole Frax Protocol. This is a great opportunity for both platforms to take advantage of a newly established endgame ecosystem.

This benefits Frax as a whole by:

Exposure: FRAX trading pairs on zkSync and StarkNet beating other stable coins to the L2s

Revenue: through the spread from market making; current revenue is ~$2k a day and revenue will go up linearly as volume increases

Future potential: As ZigZag grows, we will introduce margin trading in which Frax will also be earning yield off.

Frax Comptrollers

Summary:

Swap $3m worth of FXS for OHM to be staked through the Frax treasury, at a 30-day time-weighted average price.

Background & Motivation:

As Frax's first major asset partnership back in May 2021, OlympusDAO's bond program has led its treasury to hold more than $48m worth of FRAX as of November 2021. We as the Comptrollers propose a $3m FXS <> OHM token swap to further align incentives between the two protocols as we progress through the era of DeFi 2.0 together.

With the recent launch of Olympus Pro, Frax is also accumulating protocol-controlled liquidity through FRAX-ETH SUSHI LP

Olympus Pro bonds , emitting FXS from the liquidity mining allocation to do so. As the two protocols continue to innovate, we believe that further collaboration will continue to benefit all token holders of both OHM and FXS.

The proposed token swap would be marked at a 30-day trailing time-weighted average price from the end of the snapshot vote, and would occur shortly thereafter.

Proposal:

Add the UniV3 FRAX/agEUR stablecoin pair to FRAX Gauges

Abstract: agEUR is a Euro stablecoin issued by the Angle Protocol. It is the biggest Euro stablecoin in the market. The Angle Protocol is soon going to launch FRAX as a collateral making it another integration for the FRAX ecosystem.

As mentionned in the forum thread, there would be multiple benefits for this gauge:

1.) Create Euro exposure for FRAX holders through the FRAX/agEUR pool

2.) Angle is going to further incentivize the gauge with ANGLE rewards doubling the token rewards for users

3.) Build a partnership with a decentralized stablecoin protocol (that does not plan to go to USD) that builds in itself many interesting use cases for FRAX holders like strategies for FRAX on Aave

Summary:

Vesq.io 33 is an Olympus inspired project that seeks to be the reserve currency of the Polygon ecosystem. Their prelaunch event has allocated FRAX protocol an allotment of pVESQ tokens to purchase. This proposal is to use $300,000 of AMO profits that accrue to the balance sheet to swap for pVESQ that has been allotted for our protocol.

Background & Motivation:

The Vesq Protocol is a reserve currency system being built for the Polygon ecosystem. Vesq is going to use FRAX as one of its predominant stablecoins in its treasury and issue VESQ-FRAX bonds at launch. FRAX is also going to build out its Polygon ecosystem with Vesq in lending markets, liquidity, and hopefully other collaborations to come. FRAX developers have talked to the Vesq core team multiple times.

FRAX protocol earns ~$400,000/day from AMOs. Thus, we can swap FRAX stablecoins earned as profit to participate in the Vesq.io 33 launch and show our support. This would also be a great DAO <> DAO opportunity as it aligns both protocols to grow together on Polygon.

Summary:

The 2nd Tokemak C.o.R.E. vote is active with 48 hours left to vote for the next five Tokemak reactors. We propose to bribe $150k worth of FXS from the community allocation at comptroller discretion to help fund a TEMPLE reactor for TempleDAO on Tokemak.

Background & Motivation:

Tokemak's C.o.R.E. competition allows TOKE holders to vote on which reactors are added next to the platform. A Tokemak reactor takes in the specified token ($TEMPLE in this case) and matches it again $TOKE. Both sides are open to deposits by the public, so anyone is able to get yield from the reactor by depositing either token. The reactors are controlled by ""Liquidity Directors"", which are responsible for deploying the asset and earning yield, which goes back to the depositors.

We propose supporting TempleDAO's choice to intake $FRAX by helping them out in the current reactor vote, as well as establishing a step towards future collaboration.

Note that since the C.o.R.E. vote ends in 48 hours, this is a shortened snapshot vote of 24 hours to allow for the circumstances.

Summary:

The

October 28th Convex votium bribe snapshot continuously allocated up to $1m worth of FXS for the bi-weekly Convex Gauge-Weight Vote to bribe for the FRAX3CRV gauge on votium. As the gauges have become more competitive recently, we are proposing to increase the bribe up to $2.5m total FXS at comptroller discretion.

Background & Motivation:

The Curve pool gauge-weight vote is voted on by veCRV holders, of which Convex holds roughly half the circulating supply. Convex allows holders of vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) to vote on how the platform's veCRV should be allocated.

Votium allows for anyone to create a bribe for vlCVX holders for a specific gauge, claimable upon voting in Convex's bi-weekly snapshot allocation.

Frax currently has 15.1% of Convex's entire veCRV amount in the Curve gauge-weight vote, down from 19.5% last period. Convex's veCRV gauge allocation is re-weighted every other week, with the current vote ending on November 15th. To defend our allocation, we propose increasing the bribes to up to $2.5m total worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Rewards from increased gauge APR will be distributed across all FXS holders due to FXS1559 buying back FXS with protocol profit.

As this has been on onging allocation, the change would carry forward to future Convex gauge weight voting periods.

Add a brand new Stake DAO ETH/FRAX put selling option strategy Gauge

Background & Motivation

Our Stake DAO partnership has been mutually beneficial since the beginning and allowed both parties to increase TVL and Frax’s market cap. Stake DAO has voted for the Frax gauge with 100% of their vote on Curve since the beginning of the partnership in June, while we allocated nearly $80m of our AMOs to Stake DAO.

They have recently released an ETH/FRAX Put Selling Strategy which generates outsized yields by selling ETH put options, collateralized by LP tokens of Stake DAO’s Passive FRAX strategy (sdFRAX3CRV not staked in the current gauge), and reinvest the yield it earns back into the strategy, allowing for a compounding effect over time. Therefore, this strategy provides liquidity on Curve’s Frax pool, which is valuable to FRAX as it contributes in stabilizing the peg. You can read more about the ETH/FRAX Put Selling Strategy in this medium article 4.

Even before any incentives this strategy is expected to generate 80% APY (first week achieved APY: 108%). Similar strategy on Ribbon.finance based on yvUSDC has more than $50m of liquidity for a much lower APY. If this strategy was incentivized with FXS and SDT, we believe it would bring significant liquidity to Frax to the Curve pool. With no gauge, this strategy will be less profitable than the Passive Frax strategy which makes no sense in terms of risk / return.

Introducing a gauge for Stake DAO’s ETH/FRAX Put Selling Strategy would be profitable for the DAO as : *It will create an unexplored use case for FRAX users by providing them access to the derivative market while solving the gas costs issues of trading options *It incentivizes more FRAX liquidity on Curve since the strategy accepts FRAX3CRV LP as a deposit for the strategy *It will increase the attractivity of Frax since it is a strategy that does not exist for any other stable coin *It offers users a new risk profile: no impermanent loss risk but volatility risk on Ethereum. If the strategy is successful, a similar strategy with BTC will probably be envisaged *Stake DAO can further incentivize this gauge with SDT rewards, to add an additional layer of rewards for users *It will allow us to further tie our relationship with Stake DAO

Summary:

Allocate 1m FXS tokens to provide cross-chain liquidity for the following (but not limited to) chains: Arbitrum, Avalanche, BSC, Harmony, Fantom, Moonriver, Polygon, and Solana.

Background & Motivation:

The cross-chain bridge mechanism has been a recent success for the protocol, allowing instant mints and bridging to other chains to provide liquidity across growing parts of the ecosystem. We propose to formally allocate 1m FXS tokens from the original farming allocation to provide liquidity across these chains and bootstrap DEX efforts.

The Frax protocol currently has 99.8m total FXS supply at a circulating FRAX supply of 550m. To expand the liquidity to other chains and increase our presence, we propose the 1m cross-chain allocation for FXS. Benefits of increased cross-chain liquidity will help boost FRAX demand as it is adopted across other ecosystems and protocols.

Summary:

The previous Convex votium bribe snapshot continuously allocated up to $500k worth of FXS for the bi-weekly Convex Gauge-Weight Vote to bribe for the FRAX3CRV gauge on votium. As the gauges have become more competitive recently, we are proposing to increase the bribe up to $1m total worth of FXS at comptroller discretion.

Background & Motivation:

The Curve pool gauge-weight vote is voted on by veCRV holders, of which Convex holds roughly half the circulating supply. Convex allows holders of vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) to vote on how the platform's veCRV should be allocated.

Votium allows for anyone to create a bribe for vlCVX holders for a specific gauge, claimable upon voting in Convex's bi-weekly snapshot allocation.

Frax currently has 19.5% of Convex's entire veCRV amount in the Curve gauge-weight vote, up from 18.2% last period. Convex's veCRV gauge allocation is re-weighted every other week, with the current vote ending on November 2nd. To keep increasing our allocation, we propose increasing the bribes to up to $1m total worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Rewards from increased gauge APR will be distributed across all FXS holders due to FXS1559 buying back FXS with protocol profit.

As this has been on onging allocation, the change would carry forward to future Convex gauge weight voting periods.

50% is used to increase treasury holdings of profit making or governance type assets which could include paying for bribes, buying ETH, or buying voting power in other protocols when needed.

The upside to this is. increased rewards for veFXS holders increased assets for the protocol increased buying pressure of FXS on the open market there is no time lock so assets could be removed if better options come along

The down side to this is. the increased amount of FXS staked in TOKE will likely reduce the APR% for all investors (but investors are not locked in) we will be taking on some extra risk by staking in another protocol.

I believe there is a strong likelihood for the Casper Network to be a top tier coin, as it is made to facilitate all levels of enterprise and public adaption, while also remaining true to the values of decentralization and security. Due to the youth of the Casper Network, the network has yet to get a stable coin developed on the platform.

This would result in the treasury holding more (non-FXS) funds to use in its profit making operations and it would help these funds compound and make bigger profits over time.

The down side would be slightly less buying on the open market.

The up side would be more funds for the protocol to use in its profit making operations.

​ Move 100% of FXS1559 to veFXS Yield,​ Move 100% of FXS1559 to veFXS Yield,"Oct 22, 2021 · 6:42 AM","Oct 22, 2021 · 6:40 AM","Oct 25, 2021 · 6:40 AM","Sam did some economic modelling and strongly believes that for the current growth phase of FRAX, we should change the FXS1559 50-50 burns to 100% veFXS yield rather than burning 50% with AMO profits.

This is for a few reasons:

1.) Higher veFXS yield will lead to more FXS demand and new fraximalists entering the ecosystem to stake and lock veFXS which aligns long term incentives together. Doing this should at minimum double the current veFXS yield to 25-30% APR, significantly higher than veCRV yield which is about 8%.

2.) Burning FXS this early in the protocol’s growth phase gives exit liquidity to farmers/short term sellers when we could be re-investing the profits into creating long term veFXS stakers. Using the profits for veFXS is not the same as burning FXS because burning gives sellers a chance to exit, while increasing veFXS yield incentivizes users to become fraximalists for multiple years. In fact, Tetranode is famous for advocating for less burning of tokens (in any protocol) and more staking yield as it creates a positive sum scenario for long term holders (and not short term dumpers).

3.) Doing this should also lead to short/medium term FXS price appreciation which would make our expansion/growth faster. Although conducting monetary policy based on FXS price should be held to a minimum since governance token speculation is not something we should focus on, it is still likely a positive effect of this move.

4.) We can always re-adjust this ratio back to 50-50 (or a new ratio) per another governance discussion+vote so this is not meant to be something that cannot be reassessed.

Background and Motivation:

As part of launching FXS's Tokemak reactor we need to perform a token swap between the FXS and Tokemak treasuries. This will provide Tokemak with a reserve of FXS tokens to mitigate against impermanent loss for reactor stakers when liquidity deployment goes live and will provide Frax with a supply of Toke that can be used by Frax to direct liquidity and incentivize the FXS reactor with Tokemak rewards.

Introduction to Tokemak more broadly: https://medium.com/tokemak/introducing-tokemak-the-utility-for-sustainable-liquidity-8b99a4757301

Proposed Action:

This proposal authorizes up to 1M FXS from the FXS treasury to exchange for an equivalent amount TOKE determined by a 7 day average market price of each token.

Projected Impact:

FXS will be able to launch its own Tokemak reactor. In addition by holding a significant supply of Toke Frax will be able to both direct the FXS liquidity in the reactor and incentivize the reactor with Toke rewards. Frax will have a large seat at the Tokemak governance table from day 1. It should be noted Frax is not required to subsidize the reactor or provide rewards to stakers; stakers in FXS's reactor will receive Toke rewards provided by the Toke team.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/QmacbKvU4sA2ww1MfhUTk5tebCiVbTsb7FgcTk3UPEUrFt

Summary:

Allocate $200k worth of FXS for the

October 14th Convex Gauge-Weight Vote to bribe for the FRAX3CRV gauge on votium. If the gauge becomes competitive, the bribe can be increased up to $500k total at comptroller discretion.

Background & Motivation:

The Curve pool gauge-weight vote is voted on by veCRV holders, of which Convex holds roughly half the circulating supply. Convex allows holders of vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) to vote on how the platform's veCRV should be allocated.

Votium allows for anyone to create a bribe for vlCVX holders for a specific gauge, claimable upon voting in Convex's bi-weekly snapshot allocation.

Frax currently has 18.2% of Convex's entire veCRV amount in the Curve gauge-weight vote, up from 9% a month ago. Convex's veCRV gauge allocation is re-weighted every other week, with the current vote ending on October 18th. To keep increasing our allocation, we propose a $200k bribe of FXS taken from the original farming allocation, with an option of an additional $300k for up to $500k total at comptroller discretion. Rewards from increased gauge APR will be distributed across all FXS holders due to FXS1559 buying back FXS with protocol profit.

Since the Convex re-weight occurs biweekly, this is an ongoing allocation. Frax currently has an 11.5% share of all of the CRV inflation through the gauges.

Summary:

Activate cross chain Lending and Liquidity/AMM AMOs on Polygon, Arbitrum, Moonriver+Moonbeam, Fantom, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Solana, Harmony, Optimism, Boba Network, and Avalanche which will allow collateral/USDC/protocol assets to flow through these chains.

Approve minting of up to $20m FRAX+FXS per chain for AMOs on the following networks: Polygon, Arbitrum, Moonriver+Moonbeam, Fantom, BSC, Solana, Harmony, Optimism, Boba Network, and Avalanche.

Background & Motivation:

FRAX has aggressively set up the infrastructure and bridging required to expand to Polygon, Moonriver+Moonbeam, Fantom, BSC, Solana, Optimism, Harmony, Boba Network, and Avalanche. With final testing approaching completion, Comptrollers are ready to activate certain lending and liquidity market operation activities to kickstart deep borrow markets and trading depth on each of the above networks.

This proposal is to activate 1 Lending AMO and 1 Liquidity AMO per chain. Comptrollers will pick the most promising and reputable lending market and AMM per chain to conduct initial algorithmic market operations on. For example, on AVAX, we are planning to mint FRAX into Benqi’s lending market and mint FRAX-FXS and/or FRAX-USDC liquidity into Pangolin DEX.

We plan to conduct the analog of these market operations on each chain with a limit of up to $20m per chain (with another governance vote needed to increase this ceiling). For minted FRAX on such chains, the CR will adjust accordingly on ETH L1 and keep global count across all chains. All FRAX+FXS is entirely fungible and there is only 1 CR globally across all chains so that there is no excessive minting occurring that could affect FRAX peg performance on ETH or any other chain since arbitrage is kept open across all FRAX+FXS across every network.

Author

Sam Kazemian, Frax core devs, & input/feedback from Ohmies in the community (jawz, Wartull, Zeus, and other big Ohmies)

Summary

Liquidity for FRAX is key for the Frax Ecosystem. However, this liquidity can come at a steep price due to the emissions needed to sustain that liquidity. Recently we have been accruing ETH on the balance sheet for FXS-ETH LP per governance vote. This governance vote is to further our collaboration with the Olympus community to become founding users of their Olympus Bond System for balance sheet accrual of FRAX-ETH SLP bonds.

The Solution

We are proposing an FXS bond program in partnership with Olympus. We will offer 90K FXS each month available for purchase via bonds. These bonds will be targeting a FRAX/ETH pair on Sushiswap. This LP will be locked into the balance sheet of the protocol counted as assets similar to our other assets like CVX, ETH, etc. This can will help us build a permanent liquidity for FRAX (first as SLP on Sushiswap but redeployable with governance to other places/L2s etc if necessary).

With the accumulated LP tokens from the sales of FXS bonds, Frax will also have the ability to farm additional tokens with a potential Onsen allocation as well as earn fees on top of the acquired LP. For example, Olympus earned around 2.5m in fees in their first 4 months.

Implementation: In essence, Olympus is offering it’s bonding program to Frax through its Bond product pilot for protocols that have a direct relationship with the DAO. This would include having the UI built for this program, helping us set everything up, and continuing to maintain the parameters for the program. In exchange for their support and expertise, Olympus would take a 3.3% fee on all FXS bonds sold. Olympus will use the FXS they earned from their fees as extra backing for OHM, which would help to reduce the circulating supply even further since it will be locked in their treasury. They have also expressed interest in locking this FXS as veFXS directly if they are whitelisted so the FXS fees could go directly to furthering Olympus DAO’s extra alignment with Frax.

Olympus bonds offer the FXS at a discount to the user for providing SLP tokens. This discount will be closely monitored and can be considered as a success factor where this would preferably be less than 10% on average (Olympus bonds have an average of 6-7% discount).

These FXS bonds will have a two week linear vesting period (14 days). This is to ensure that discount buyers can’t immediately flip their positions because they typically will be buying at a discount. The FXS bonds will continually vest, so you will be able to make partial claims before the vesting period is over if you want to sell, farm, or LP with the FXS.

Conclusion

We propose to be founding partners in this program to further our collaboration with Olympus and accrue balance sheet assets for Frax in the form of further FRAX-ETH liquidity. This also opens up the opportunity to bootstrap other pools if/when needed through this program and further align the communities of both Frax and Olympus.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/QmcBYpiAiYpDisC3r5g3adMNNQqJZnM4TCPtHR2Pe2h3kX

Summary:

Re-deploy the USDC Frax Pool to only allow minting of FRAX when the price is above the peg window, and redeeming when the price is below the peg window.

To start, the peg window will be between [$0.9933, $1.0033], where FRAX will be redeemable or mintable past those prices, respectively.

Background & Motivation:

The current version of the Frax Pool released at genesis allows for minting and redeeming of FRAX at the collateral ratio. As the system has grown over the past 8 months while holding the peg perfectly, the demand and depth of liquidity for FXS has increased respectively. Since mints and redeems offer the swap of FRAX to FXS + USDC at no slippage, arbitrageurs may profit off of FXS volatility by arbitraging against the Frax Pool.

To fix this, we are proposing to update the Frax Pool implementation to match the AMO specs listed in the documentation so that minting and redeeming are able to be called by the public only when the FRAX TWAP deviates outside of the peg. FRAX will still be able to be traded at the peg in the curve pool , which will act as the first and primary source of liquidity for the protocol. This proposal protects the FXS price long-term.

Additionally, we are implementing the passed

FIP-15 update to buyback with this new Frax Pool improvement.

Lastly, the recollateralize function will also target the new CR by minting FXS and selling it for FRAX thus increasing the CR. This is the exact symetrical specs to FIP-15 for the buyback function.

Add a Stake DAO gauge to veFXS gauges.

Our Stake DAO partnership has been quite successful and mutually beneficial. Our friends at Stake DAO have voted for FRAX with their veCRV and FRAX has successfully used Stake DAO’s custom FRAX strategy vault to increase the protocol’s AMO profits.

Recently Stake DAO expanded their retail FRAX strategy and we think it’s a great idea to boost adoption for this strategy with a gauge.

Governance discussion thread here: https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-20-stake-dao-gauge/122

Expected gauge benefits:

1.) It essentially incentivizes more FRAX Curve liquidity since Stake DAO takes FRAX3CRV LP as deposits similar to Curve/Convex.

2.) Stake DAO is a whitelisted protocol that can stake veFXS so it will be in Stake DAO’s interest to build up the gauge weight for this in the future.

3.) Expand on our already successful partnership before which has gotten FRAX a lot of veCRV votes and Stake DAO $50m+ of TVL.

This would expand Pickle’s offering as well as allow them to further incentivize selected gauge pairs with PICKLE. Overall, this seems like a win-win for both protocols if they work together.

Authors:

Justin Bram, Brazy

Summary:

This proposal seeks to unlock the FRAX<>ETH liquidity providers, create a UniV3 gauge for FRAX<>ETH, and transfer a portion of the emissions to the overall gauge system to increase the gauge emissions to 25,000 FXS/day.  This would NOT affect the overall daily FXS emissions, it would only affect the emissions controlled by the gauge system.

Proposal:

At the moment, the overall gauge system has emissions of approximately 16,400 FXS/day, which came from the original UniV2 Frax<>USDC pool. The Frax<>ETH pool is also receiving rewards of approximately 16,400 FXS/day. We propose to end the FRAX<>ETH emission, and transfer about 52% of these emissions into the overall gauge system. As a result, the gauge system would be responsible for approximately 25,000 FXS/day of emissions. The remaining 48% (approx. 7,890 FXS/day) would go to the Frax Protocol Treasury. This will help the protocol build a big war chest, and it would be beneficial for the long-term health of the protocol. Every FXS we save now is one that we can use later to pay for locked liquidity or investments in the protocol. This also buys us more time to develop the protocol and revenue sources so that we can sustainably pay for locked liquidity when the initial liquidity incentives run out.

Furthermore, we propose to approve a UniV3 gauge for FRAX<>ETH. This would allow veFXS stakers to vote on how high the emissions for this pool should be. This gauge should be launched whenever the team is ready to implement it.

The current FRAX<>ETH pool is quite costly from a protocol perspective and provides little benefit aside from locking up FRAX. According to Uniswap analytics, this pool typically only sees between $1-2M of volume each day. We could support the demand with a much smaller pool.

Because of the large FRAX<>Stablecoin pools, this liquidity isn’t especially useful. If this proposal were implemented and the new pool was only minimally incentivized, users could use the FRAX → USDC/DAI → ETH Uniswap route for large transactions.

Benefits:

Increases the number of rewards available to the gauge system

Reduces the amount of FXS that enters the open market daily

Allows the community to decide how the Frax<>ETH pool should be incentivized

Allows the community to support emissions for new integrations and pairs (example: Sushi gauge)

Drawbacks:

A large amount of locked up Frax will be unlocked

Summary

Allocate $20,000 worth of FXS per month for 3 months paid monthly to Dennis with half of the amount provably locked as veFXS for 4 years. This is a total of $60k worth of FXS over 3 months in total. Dennis will build the first perpetual leverage pool AMO for FRAX. Dennis is a prominent community member that has helped us model AMOs, review code, and has a great history of improving FRAX protocol since genesis. He previously discussed the idea to build on the forum here: https://gov.frax.finance/t/leverage-without-liquidation/88

Proposal

Build a no-liquidation perpetual leverage pool for the FRAX ecosystem.

All deposits are in FRAX.

Users can easily take a long and short position on ETH/BTC etc.

Fixed leverage, positions are rebalanced after every interval.

No liquidations needed due to fixed leverage.

Trades are against a liquidity providers pool that accrues fees.

Open source Solidity contracts and simple UI.

FIP 15 - Update Protocol Buyback Function,FIP 15 - Update Protocol Buyback Function,"Aug 17, 2021 · 3:01 AM","Aug 17, 2021 · 5:00 AM","Aug 20, 2021 · 5:00 AM","Link to Original Forum Thread - https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-15-update-protocol-buyback-function/82

Summary:

Change the Frax protocol buyback function to preserve collateral within the protocol.

Background & Motivation:

Note - This proposal is entirely focused on the protocol buyback function, which is not to be confused with buybacks from protocol generated revenue. This proposal would not alter buybacks from protocol generated revenue or FXS-1559.

The Frax protocol buyback function is a mechanism to match the protocol’s target collateralization ratio (CR) with the actual CR. When the amount of collateral in the system exceeds the target amount (actual CR > target CR), the buyback function becomes available. Currently, the buyback function uses existing collateral (USDC at this time) to create a limit order to buy FXS that equals the amount of excess collateral in the protocol. The protocol is essentially removing excess collateral by purchasing FXS.

While this approach has been successful to date, the downside is that it balances the CR by removing collateral from the system. There is an alternate approach, which now appears to be the better path forward: instead of removing collateral from the protocol, the protocol can mint additional FRAX such that the new total balance of FRAX divided by the existing collateral equals the target CR rate. This additional amount of FRAX minted to balance the CR would then be used to purchase FXS on the open market, likely in a similar manner to FXS-1559 (though 100% would be used to buy and burn FXS).

There are three obvious benefits to the change. Long term it encourages the growth of Frax’s balance sheet by adding liabilities (additional FRAX) rather than shrinking the balance sheet by removing assets (removing collateral). The additional FRAX ultimately boosts the total FRAX supply.

It is now obvious that protocol collateral is incredibly valuable to Frax. Frax is currently on pace to earn 8 figures of protocol revenue in 2021 primarily driven by the effective use of idle protocol collateral. Reducing collateral leads to a reduction in revenue. This change will preserve protocol collateral within the protocol and increase protocol revenue compared with the current buyback function.

The final benefit is that it shifts the protocol from a passive to an active buyer for buybacks. So rather than have a sitting limit order for FXS at the oracle price, the protocol will actively conduct buybacks on the open market in the same manner that FXS-1559 currently operates. While the size of the buyback in FXS terms may be less due to slippage, the ability to execute it on demand may offset any slippage (2% slippage doesn’t matter if the order sits for a day and the price of FXS increases by 5% in that time). It is important that 100% of the FRAX generated for the buyback be used for the buyback and not allocated via the FXS-1559 fee split.

Summary:

Activate the Uni v3 AMO (source code) which allows for the protocol to deposit idle collateral and mint new FRAX to act as an LP in any Uni v3 pool.

Background & Motivation:

The Uni v3 AMO allows for the Frax protocol to deposit collateral held in the Frax Pool and mint new FRAX alongside it to enter any FRAX-paired Uni v3 pool.

Uniswap v3's range orders give LPs the ability to earn fees for trades inside of arbitrarily tight price ranges, allowing the AMO to generate passive income for excess collateral held inside the Frax Pools not already deployed.

The AMO will initially start with FRAX-USDC on Uni v3, with the comptrollers reserving the right to swap for and enter different FRAX Uni v3 stablecoin pairs using the collateral. The AMO has the functional ability to enter and exit any number of Uni v3 positions.

Add a FRAX-SUSHI Sushiswap gauge to veFXS gauges.

Background & Motivation:

In an effort to diversify gauge weights and signal that veFXS gauges are not simply for 1 particular type of AMM, it is proposed to add a Sushiswap FRAX-SUSHI pair to the veFXS gauges. Sushiswap has supported FRAX since its early days by adding it to their Onsen menu back in February. Additionally, they have added FRAX pairs on Polygon and their other chain deployments.

SUSHI has a predominant amount of liquidity against ETH and almost none against any stablecoin. The system uses ETH to route in and out of stablecoins. While this is fine for them, it would be prudent to become their stablecoin of choice by providing a high amount of liquidity directly for SUSHI. Additionally, some Sushi chefs have expressed interest in supporting FRAX further if they get a gauge. This will also advance FRAX's multichain strategy with Sushiswap and opens the door for future cross-chain collaboration.

Lastly, having gauges on multiple AMMs shows credible neutrality that veFXS gauges are not only for Uni v3 pairs. This is important as FRAX seeks to win over other protocols to buy into the gauge system by being AMM-agnostic.

This proposal does not affect future proposals adding other gauges as planned such as other stable-stable Uni v3 pairs. Anyone in the community and other projects can proposal veFXS gauges on any AMM with FRAX and/or FXS being part of the pair.

Activate veFXS gauges to supplant the Uni v2 FRAX-USDC farming pair, redirecting the FXS rewards on that pair to the veFXS gauge system which can be voted on by veFXS holders, similar to

Curve’s gauges

Background & Motivation:

The veFXS system is currently returning 50% APR on single-asset FXS stakers (at a rate of 1 FXS locked for 4 years), with profits coming from the FXS1559 AMO which currently buys back FXS from the market using interest earned from lending out collateral to Aave, Compound, and Yearn.

The current FXS farming system is incentivizng Uni v2 FRAX-USDC pair with roughly 16,400 FXS/day each, taken from the 60% farming allocation of the FXS distribution. By adding gauges, veFXS holders are able to vote on where the FXS inflation will go, directly proportional to the veFXS vote amount. Additionally, the gauge system will allow for new incentivized asset pairs against FRAX to be added in through governance. The current FRAX-WETH and FRAX-FXS farming rewards on Uni v2 will not be affected by this proposal.

The gauge activation will start with the Uni v2 FRAX-USDC emissions and move them to the first gauge, Uni v3 FRAX-USDC. All locked stakes in the new gauge system and subsequent farming systems will remain locked and not be unlocked. This proposal only affects the Uni v2 FRAX-USDC pair and any new farming partnerships.

If adopted , this proposal seeks to:

Activate the veFXS gauges with FRAX/USDC, FRAX/DAI, and FRAX/mUSD as initial pairs

Set precedent for the addition of future gauges

This benefits Frax as a whole by:

Allowing FXS farming emissions to be redirected in accordance to veFXS holders

Author

Mark11/Capt - Community Members (resubmission of a prior FIP authored by Sam Kazemian)

Summary

Redirect the 50% of FXS1559 burns to purchase ETH on Uniswap and place it in FXS-ETH LP - only when FXS trades above $1.50 - for a trial period of 60 days. After 60 days, the community can vote to extend this ETH purchase program or re-instate burns. This would be a trial run to see how reinvesting AMO profits into the protocol goes.

Background

Sam Kazemian previously authored FIP 2 which passed with 92%, however, as FRAX governance was in its infancy, it had low turnout and was therefore not executed.

After further discussions within the community we believe it is time to revisit this proposal and determine if it has broad support through re-proposing it for a snapshot vote.

Abstract

If adopted, this proposal seeks to route 50% of the AMO profits that are currently going to burning FXS to purchasing protocol owned ETH for 60 days. The ETH will continually be placed in FXS-ETH LP through an AMO. The LP is not eligible to earn any farming rewards so it would not be competitive in any way with community rewards. Currently there is no FXS rewards for any FXS-ETH pair, but if there was, the FXS-ETH AMO would not be eligible for FXS yields so it would not be competitive with farmers. Additionally the mechanism would only operate when FXS is trading above $1.50 - when it is trading at or below $1.50 the purchasing of ETH would be switched off until FXS trades above $1.50 again.

Motivation

A prior governance proposal created by Justin Bram and Brazy.eth successfully passed to reroute 50% of AMO profits to veFXS holders and we considered it very successful for the protocol. This current FXS-ETH proposal was inspired by YFI’s similar idea of “own the land on which we operate” posted here: Own The Land (Eth) On Which We Operate - Finance - yearn.finance 2

Sam believes (and we agree) reinvesting part of the AMO profits back into the protocol itself could yield just as much of a success if not more. This 60-day trial period is ideal and does not commit to changing the FXS1559 dynamic other than accruing more FXS-ETH liquidity which is a great way to trial increase FXS value in this way. Additionally, if FXS1559 burns are re-instated, a governance proposal can be made to simply use the accrued ETH to burn the FXS itself which would retroactively create a similar amount of deflationary pressure for FXS if desired.

The FXS price floor guarantee of $1.50 to switch off this mechanism and channel back to full burns - is to provide confidence to FXS holders that the full burn will be reinstated when FXS token price is low.

Risks

There is a risk that the price of ETH crashes making the purchased ETH-FXS less valuable than other opportunities. The length of the trial should mitigate any substantial impact of this occurring.

Voting

For: support the purchasing of ETH with one quarter of the total AMO profits (coming out of the portion currently burning FXS) - and depositing to FXS-ETH LP pair through an AMO for 60 day trial period. Approving this proposal would make AMO profits distribution as follows: 25% burn FXS, 25% purchase ETH, 50% distributed to veFXS. This mechanism will be programmatically switched off whenever FXS trades at or below $1.50 and instead will use the portion to continue FXS burns until price returns above $1.50.

Against: no change at this time",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/QmUUmxEEGGr5fzoffZdtnwHgDTR52YkfhsVtVYrgu81Wsw

Discussion thread: https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-6-protocol-decentralization-comptrollers/43/5

Summary

Allow for Comptroller addresses (currently the core team) to control monetary policy within FRAX peg bounds of 1.01 - .99 and create public recollateralize() & decollateralize() functions for all AMOs outside of the peg bounds so that all protocol functions are fully trustless above/below the peg.

Motivation

The protocol should require no trust assumptions by any delegates or whitelisted keys outside of the peg bounds. Within the peg bounds, delegated/whitelisted accounts can conduct monetary policy expeditiously so long as the FRAX price peg is within bounds. Additionally, we’d propose adding timelocks to certain functions such as adding/removing AMOs even if the price is within the peg bounds.

We propose that within the peg’s bounds, delegated addresses should be afforded privileges to conduct monetary policy such as rebalancing AMOs, updating the CR by 1 tick (currently set to .25%) per t period (t =1 hour), and other monetary policy. These delegates are called “Comptrollers of the Currency” and currently only the core team. They can be added/removed by timelocked FIP-style governance vote. Currently, only the team has any privileges, but others can be added in the future that join the core team or are prominent community members.

If adopted, this proposal seeks to:

Add public decollateralize() & recollateralize() functions to all future AMO deployments that can be called by any user outside of the peg bounds to restore the FRAX peg trustlessly.

Allow for ""Comptrollers"" to conduct monetary policy as long as the FRAX peg remains in the bounds 1.01 - .99 as defined by the Uniswap FRAX-USDC & FRAX3CRV TWAPs (and future FRAX-USD Chainlink oracle). Outside of peg bounds, all CR updates, AMO recollateralize() & decollateralize() functions are callable by anyone.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/QmZuSjSViHrVpJU6X2ptk8M25jcrs2g4VvQL5ZUy4SmJjo

Summary

Incentivize the saddle.finance

D4 pool (

FRAX , alUSD ,

LUSD ,

FEI ) with 1200 FXS per day.

Motivation

Saddle is an automated market maker for stablecoins based off of Curve's

StableSwap invariant , allowing for low slippage when trading between the stablecoins in a pool. To attract liquidity to the D4 pool, incentives will be proposed by each protocol in the form of their governance token as staking rewards for the pool LP token: FXS, ALCX, LQTY, and TRIBE. This will allow holders of the assets in the decentralized stablecoin pool to swap between each other with minimal slippage.

Currently, liquidity between these stablecoins is fragmented across decentralized exchanges Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, and Curve.fi. By putting them together in a saddle pool, it will not only link the stablecoins to each other but also create cross-dex swap infrastructure through these assets.

If adopted , this proposal seeks to:

Incentivize the Saddle D4 pool with 1200 FXS/day

Coordinate with other decentralized stablecoin protocols to maintain liquidity rewards

This benefits Frax as a whole by:

Creating a native pool to swap between FRAX, alUSD, LUSD, and FEI

Frax currently has substantial unspent profits that were accumulated before FXS-1559 was implemented; estimated to be in excess of $1.17m.  This proposal would authorize the team to begin purchasing FXS, at their discretion, with a goal of maximizing the amount of FXS purchased.  Without this proposal, the funds will continue to sit in the protocol.  The intent has always been for protocol profits to be used to purchase FXS (whether for buyback and burn or distribution). This proposal authorizes the team to begin purchases.  The ultimate use of the FXS - whether it goes into the DAO treasury, is burned or shared with veFXS - can be determined by a subsequent proposal.  The intent is to begin buybacks to take advantage of the current market price.  The ultimate size of the buyback could be 3-5% of the current circulating supply, which would expand the treasury by over 12%.

Currently, 100% of AMO profits are going to FXS-1559 to buyback and burn FXS. Instead, we propose to redirect 50% of AMO profits to buyback and distribute FXS to veFXS holders.

Motivation

This proposal is motivated by lack of incentive for people to vote-lock their FXS. By adding these rewards, community members will be incentivized to participate in protocol governance. veFXS follows the Curve Finance vote-lock model. veCRV holders currently receive 50% of trading fees from the protocol. At this time, partially due to these incentives, about 50% of CRV supply is vote-locked into veCRV for an average of 3.65 years. We propose to follow a similar reward structure, and hopefully see similar success for the Frax protocol.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/QmRY3EPki9WX4WgGib6A6kuFQmMWo1keQgxtiRq3N2J945

Summary

Approve vote boosts and yield for FXS single-asset staking as veFXS

Background veFXS is a fork of Curve’s veCRV code. Users may lock up their FXS for up to 4 years for four times the amount of veFXS (e.g. 100 FXS locked for 4 years returns 400 veFXS). The veFXS balance linearly decreases as tokens approach their lock expiry, approaching 1 veFXS per 1 FXS at zero lock time remaining. This encourages long-term staking and an active community. Sushiswap has proposed a similar implementation with their recently announced oSushi token

A sample graph (Curve’s veCRV) illustrating the decrease can be found at this address .

Purpose

The purpose of veFXS is to reward long-term FXS hodlers and incentivize farmers to stake FXS.

The functionality of veFXS is described as follows:

Voting Power

Each veFXS will have 1 vote in governance proposals. Staking 1 FXS for the maximum time, 4 years, would generate 4 veFXS. This veFXS balance itself will slowly decay down to 1 veFXS after 4 years, at which time the user can redeem the veFXS back for FXS. In the meantime, the user can also increase their veFXS balance by locking up FXS, extending the lock end date, or both. It should be noted that veFXS is non-transferable.

Farming Boosts

Holding veFXS will give the user more weight when collecting farming rewards. The overall emission will remain the same. Curve has their max at 2.5x and we propose the same. [1] [2]

Yield

After the implementation of veFXS, holders may be able to collect rewards periodically. The emission rate would vary, depending on the implementation of how the yield is obtained and market price of FXS.

Future Functionality

The veFXS system is modular and all-purpose. In the future, it can be expanded to vote on AMO weights, earn additional yield in new places/features, and be treated as a governance token-like bond of sorts.

If adopted , this proposal seeks to:

Give veFXS voting rights

Have future farms (e.g. Uniswap v3) include a reward weight boost to veFXS holders

This benefits Frax as a whole by:

Allocate voting power to long-term holders of FXS through veFXS

This proposal establishes the following governance process for Frax:

Proposal Development and Discussion

With the exception of non-controversial parameter adjustments by Frax developers, all proposals must be posted to the governance forum and have a discussion period prior to vote.

5 day minimum discussion period for all proposals except meta-governance or FXS emission related  proposals.

10 day minimum discussion period for meta-governance or FXS emission related proposals.

Meta-governance proposals are proposals that change the governance process of the Frax protocol or impact how the protocol is governed.  Emission related proposals alter FXS emissions.  Unless they seek to establish recurring FXS incentives, proposals for the DAO to spend FXS from the treasury are not emission related.

Forum posts of proposals should include a forum vote for feedback and signaling.  Final proposals must be posted on the forum under the FIP category. Links to the Snapshot vote need to be included on the same thread.

Voting Process

Voting currently take place on Frax’s Snapshot.

5000 FXS is the minimum amount of FXS to start a valid Snapshot vote.

Votes must be for a minimum of 3 days.

A simple majority (50% + 1) wins the vote.

Votes may only be binary options (for or against).

Use a signaling vote on the forum to measure more than two options.

Quorum

A quorum of 5% of the circulating supply of FXS is required for the result to be valid, unless the proposal alters meta-governance or FXS emissions.

For meta-governance or FXS emission related votes, a quorum of 10% of the circulating supply of FXS is required for the result to be valid.

The circulating supply calculation is based on the block of the Snapshot vote.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/QmUdpd4F6k9KXc6MEUvWGKLhBDLZbDj2XDRNZC8cNmjNTa

Summary

Move the FRAX3CRV-f metapool LP tokens to the Frax Investor Custodian EOA to obtain boosted CRV yields.

Motivation

Curve's Locker contract is the contract used for locking CRV to get veCRV votes. Externally owned accounts may generate veCRV as they wish, but smart contract accounts must be whitelisted in order to be able to generate veCRV votes and participate in Curve governance source . The whitelisting process is unrelated to normal Curve listing, and we are unsure at what point we can get whitelisted. As a result, we propose to move all of the Frax metapool LP tokens to a team-controlled EOA to get the 2.5x boost on CRV yields on the Frax gauge as a voter, and lock the farmed CRV for more veCRV to vote for higher Frax gauge weights. Our updated Curve AMO contract implementation that supports this logic can be found here

If adopted , this proposal seeks to:

Move the metapool LP tokens to the Frax Investor Custodian EOA from the updated Curve AMO

Deposit the LP tokens into the FRAX gauge to receive a boost in CRV yields

Vote-lock the CRV yields for veCRV

Use the veCRV to vote for higher Frax gauge weights

This benefits Frax as a whole by:

Summary

Change Collateral Ratio (CR) Boost on Farming Rewards to 1x (no boost).

Abstract

If adopted, this proposal seeks to:

Change cr_boost_max_multiplier on the FRAX-USDC, FRAX-FXS, and FRAX-WETH staking rewards contracts to 1e6 (1000000 with 6 decimals of precision = 1x boost)

This benefits Frax as a whole by:

Lowering emissions from a current rate of 56,000 FXS/day at a 86.50% CR, negatively correlated to the CR, to a constant 49,315 FXS/day. This also benefits farmers and locked stakers because the CR boost was a uniform boost across all emissions, so with it paused, it means that only locked stakers earn any kind of bonus boost. Their proportion of boosted emission increases since unlocked stakers do not earn any kind of boost (currently they earn CR boost).

Motivation

This proposal is motivated by the current high amount of FXS rewards emitted per day by the staking contracts. By turning off the CR boost, the protocol would slow down emissions, extending the duration of the yield farming program and easing selling pressure on the FXS price from farmers. The likely rise in demand+scarcity of FXS would most likely keep farming yields the comparable, if not better. It also tips the balance in favor of locked LPs since that is the only way to earn any form of boosted rewards.

Liquidity is still important, so we propose to keep locked stakes as-is. Additionally, this makes locked stakers earn the only kind of boost in the entire ecosystem. This proposal would not affect rewards already distributed.",https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/QmVeg2BF6GffyXszre57k398cjMuxvsSLaLxGKgmKEWLhw
