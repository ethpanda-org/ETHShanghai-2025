## Introduction: The Path Forward
As Frax continues to evolve in the dynamic DeFi landscape, it faces both challenges and opportunities that demand strategic action. The following proposals are crafted to address these pivotal areas by enhancing economic resilience, governance integrity, and service versatility. This coordinated approach ensures that Frax not only adapts to current market conditions but also thrives in the future.

## Core Initiative 1: Dynamic Fee Retention Model with Safeguards for Enhanced Protocol Sustainability
**Proposal Description:** Implement a dynamic fee retention model where 10% of generated fees are initially retained by the Frax treasury, with the community having the governance capability to adjust this rate between 5% and 15%.
**Background:** Currently, Frax distributes 100% of generated fees, which limits the treasury's ability to fund growth initiatives or buffer against downturns.
**Motivation:** This proposal aims to build a sustainable economic model that balances fee distribution with strategic reinvestment, enhancing long-term protocol stability and growth.
**Options:**
- **For:** Supports a sustainable economic model with safeguards against manipulation, promoting strategic reinvestment.
- **Against:** Maintains the current model, focusing on immediate and total fee distribution to holders.

## Core Initiative 2: Secure and Equitable On-chain Governance Activation
**Proposal Description:** Transition Frax's governance from an off-chain model to an on-chain system using a Governor contract with advanced security features and equitable voting mechanisms.
**Background:** Frax's current off-chain governance lacks the full benefits of security and transparency provided by on-chain execution.
**Motivation:** By moving to an on-chain governance model, Frax aims to enhance the integrity and transparency of its decision-making processes, fostering greater community trust and participation.
**Options:**
- **For:** Activates a more secure and transparent on-chain governance system.
- **Against:** Retains the simpler, less resource-intensive off-chain model.

## Core Initiative 3: Risk-Managed Collateral Diversification for Fraxlend
**Proposal Description:** Broaden the range of accepted collateral on Fraxlend to include both crypto and real-world assets, backed by a robust risk management framework.
**Background:** Fraxlend's current collateral options are limited, which may restrict user participation and service appeal.
**Motivation:** This initiative aims to attract a broader user base and enhance the utility of Fraxlend by diversifying its collateral options under strict risk assessments.
**Options:**
- **For:** Expands collateral options, enhancing Fraxlend's resilience and appeal.
- **Against:** Maintains current collateral limitations, focusing on simplicity and reduced risk exposure.
