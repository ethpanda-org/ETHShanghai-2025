**CrediNet: Decentralized Trust Network Whitepaper**

**Executive Summary**

---

As we move toward the internet's next evolution—**Web3** and the  **Metaverse** —a trustworthy, composable, and user-sovereign digital identity and credit system remains a core missing cornerstone of Web3.0. Its absence hinders Web3.0's development, preventing "human-centric" affairs such as lending, insurance, property rights, and "meta-societies" from flourishing on the blockchain, especially on trusted, neutral development platforms like Ethereum. The existing credit systems are isolated, opaque, and controlled by centralized institutions, which cannot meet the demands of an open digital society.

**CrediNet** is a blockchain-based **decentralized credit protocol** that provides users with owned, self-governing, and self-benefiting credit data services. Furthermore, through the innovative  **"Credit Spectrum" model** , CrediNet transforms a user's on-chain and off-chain behavior into a dynamic and visible  **Soulbound Token (SBT)** . This SBT carries a user's biometrics, capabilities, wealth, health, and behavior, accompanying them throughout their life.

CrediNet aims to become critical infrastructure for the future **Decentralized Society (DeSoc)** and the  **Metaverse** .

**Core Innovations**

1. Use of **Blockchain Technology** to achieve privacy protection and **user data sovereignty** for credit.
2. **Credit Spectrum:** A five-dimensional model (Keystone (Biometrics), Ability, Fortune, Health, Behavior) to scientifically quantify human credit.
3. **Dynamic SBT Medal:** Generating a visualized, evolving, and interactive artwork that represents the user's credit status.
4. **Data Value Return:** Users receive token rewards for providing credible data and earn continuous **passive income** by authorizing data usage.

**I. The Fragmented Credit System**

The current digital credit system suffers from fundamental flaws:

· **Centralization and Control:** Credit data is monopolized by institutions; users lack control over their digital identity and the value it generates.

· **Data Silos:** Data related to identity, finance, health, and education are isolated, preventing the formation of a complete personal profile, thus underestimating their value.

· **Lack of Interoperability:** Web2 credit scores cannot be migrated to the Web3 world, and users lack a standard way to accumulate credit on-chain.

· **Fragmented User Experience:** Users are required to repeat **Know Your Customer (KYC)** verification repeatedly, a tedious process with high risks of privacy leaks.

· **Missing Incentives:** Users contribute valuable data to platforms but receive no return for their contribution.

Existing Web3 solutions only address partial issues but lack a comprehensive, **incentive-compatible protocol** that can quantify and visualize multi-dimensional credit.

---

**II. Overview of the CrediNet Solution**

CrediNet provides an end-to-end solution:

· **Sovereign Ownership:** Users are the sole owners of their personal data, possessing complete rights of disposal and benefit.

· **Multi-Dimensional Credit Model:** Scientific assessment of credit through five major dimensions (Keystone (Biometrics), Ability, Fortune, Health, Behavior) to form a unique **"Credit Spectrum."**

· **Verifiable Credentials:** Utilizing **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** and other technologies to verify data authenticity, protect raw data privacy, and only store the hash on-chain.

· **Economic Incentives:** Rewarding data contributors with **CRN tokens** and automatically distributing data usage revenue via smart contracts.

· **Visualized Representation:** Transforming abstract credit data into a dynamic, personalized  **SBT Medal** , which serves as the user's credit portrait in the Metaverse.

· **Passive Income:** Users earn continuous revenue by authorizing the use of their data.

**III. The Credit Spectrum — A Multi-Dimensional Dynamic Credit Model**

**CrediNet’s Credit Score (C-Score)** is a comprehensive metric calculated by weighting the following five major dimensions. It is designed to encourage authenticity, persistence, and value creation. The score is automatically generated based on the quantity and quality of user data; a higher score indicates higher credit.

| **Dimension** | **Code** | **Weight** | **Core Metric**                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Keystone**  | K              | 25%              | Identity Uniqueness, Biometric Verification, Official Document Authenticity -*The Foundation of All Credit*              |
| **Ability**   | A              | 30%              | Education Certificates, Skill Certifications, On-chain Builder History -*Proof of Core Capabilities*                     |
| **Fortune**   | F              | 20%              | Asset Diversity, Credit History, Income Stability -*Economic Robustness & Risk Resilience*                               |
| **Health**    | H              | 15%              | Physical Examination Reports, Data Continuity, Vital Sign Trends -*Sustainability & Long-Term Participation*             |
| **Behavior**  | B              | 10%              | Compliance Records, Fulfillment Rate, Governance Participation, Community Contribution -*Collaboration & Social Capital* |

The **Dynamic SBT** is the visual manifestation of the Credit Spectrum. Each SBT is a unique, non-transferable  **on-chain generated artwork** .

**IV. Technical Architecture**

CrediNet adopts a layered architecture to ensure  **security, scalability, and user sovereignty** .

1. **User DID Generation:** Adopting W3C standards to generate  **User Decentralized Identifiers (DID)** .
2. **Data Ingestion:** Users upload data via the client (or authorize API access).
3. **Data Processing:** Middleware encrypts and hashes the data to generate  **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** .
4. **Data Custody:** The  **raw data is kept in the user's custody** ; the VC hash is sent to the CrediNet smart contract and  **attested on the Ethereum mainnet** .
5. **Credit Scoring Engine:** Updates the user's **C-Score** and **Spectrum Map** based on the latest data.
6. **Medal Minting Contract:** Dynamically renders the user's **SBT Medal** based on the latest Spectrum data.
7. **Third-Party Access:** Third-party applications query the protocol layer and,  **with user authorization** , retrieve their credit profile or verifiable statements.

**Data Uplink and Processing Flow:** User Data → Client Encryption/Hashing → Upload Log → Hash Generation → Ethereum Attestation → Credit Score Update → Medal Status Refresh → Available in Data Marketplace

**XI. Risk Factors**

· **Smart Contract Risk:** While core contracts will be audited by multiple top-tier auditing firms, the possibility of vulnerabilities still exists.

· **Regulatory Uncertainty:** Global regulatory policies regarding DeFi, data privacy, and digital assets are still evolving and may impact the project.

· **Adoption Risk:** The project's success is dependent on ecosystem building and adoption by users and partners.

· **Model Risk:** The credit scoring algorithm may contain undiscovered biases, requiring continuous optimization through community governance.

· **Private Key Management:** Users must properly safeguard their private keys, as loss will result in the inability to recover their credit assets.
