Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

Don't creat unnecessary test files or documentation files unless explicitly requested.
Avoid using placeholder names like `foo`, `bar`, or `baz` in code examples. Use meaningful names that reflect the purpose of the variables or functions.
Use English as the primary language for code comments and documentation, unless the project is specifically intended for a different language audience.
When generating code, ensure that it adheres to the project's coding standards and best practices.
